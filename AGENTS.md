# KOÜ Yazılım Kulübü — agent notes

Expo SDK 57 / React Native 0.86 / expo-router. Read the exact versioned docs at
https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v57.0.0/ before writing any code — Expo has changed.

## Layout

- `app/` — expo-router routes. `app/(tabs)/` holds the four root screens plus a custom
  tab bar; everything else is a stack route.
- `src/theme.ts` — the only place colours, gradients, fonts, radii and spacing live.
- `src/data.ts` — types, fixed lists and the offline fallback. Content lives in
  Firestore; the admin panel writes it.
- `src/store.tsx` — registrations and notification prefs, persisted via AsyncStorage.

## Conventions

- Use `Txt` / `PixelTxt` from `src/components/ui.tsx` instead of raw `Text`. React Native
  does not synthesise font weights, so every weight is its own family name.
- Press Start 2P (`fonts.pixel`) is for badge labels, group headings, empty states and
  loading copy only — never body text, forms or buttons.
- Gradients are non-empty tuples (`GradientStops`). Pass `gradients.*` straight to
  `LinearGradient`; do not cast to `string[]`.
- UI copy is Turkish. Use `toLocaleLowerCase('tr')` / `toLocaleUpperCase('tr')` for case
  changes so dotted/dotless İ/ı behave.

## Checks

`npm run typecheck` must pass. `npx expo export --platform ios` catches bundling and
import errors without needing Xcode.

## Agent setup

Three layers, and only one of them lives in this repo:

- **MCP servers** — account level (claude.ai → Customize → Connectors). Nothing to copy;
  they are just there. On 21st.dev: `search` and all listing/metadata calls are free and
  unlimited, but **`get_component` is metered — 2 code pulls per day on the free tier**.
  Search widely, spend a pull only on a component actually being built. `get_theme`
  returns CSS free, but treat pulled themes as structural reference only, never as a
  palette source — the palette is `src/theme.ts`.
- **Account skills** — `~/.claude/skills/synced/`. Downloaded per container. Do not copy
  them here.
- **This repo** — `.claude/`, below. This is the part that is version controlled.

```

```

Repo-level skills load automatically — no install step, no network call, which is why
they are committed rather than installed. The hook exists because the cloud container is
rebuilt every session and graphify is the one thing it does not keep.

`graphify` maps the codebase into a queryable graph instead of re-reading it. It was
written from scratch here, so for a while there was nothing foreign to map — that stopped
being true once the admin panel, the event schema and the notification layer arrived.

**The graph is per-session and `graphify-out/` is gitignored.** The container is rebuilt
every time, and a committed graph would go stale the moment the code moved — a stale graph
is worse than none, because it describes a structure that no longer exists with complete
confidence. Rebuild it instead:

```
/graphify .
```

Three things worth scoping out when you do: the `assets/*.png` icons (the skill spends one
subagent per image and they say nothing about architecture), `.claude/skills/*` (agent
discipline prose, not part of the app), and **`design-source/`**. That last one is not
obvious and cost a rebuild to learn: it is a design-tool export kept for reference, not
shipping code, and its two bundled scripts took 121 of 597 nodes — a fifth of the graph —
and pushed `ImageSlot`, `get()` and `createRuntime()` above `useAppStore()` and
`useContent()` in the god-node ranking. The graph names the wrong centres unless it is
excluded.

`AGENTS.md` and `README.md` are worth keeping — they carry the data-flow description the
code alone does not state. Expect roughly a third of the doc-derived edges to dangle;
the AST half is deterministic and trustworthy, the prose half is not.

**Once it exists, questions about architecture, file relationships or project content are
graph queries first (`graphify query`, `path`, `explain`), file scans second.**

## Working rules

- **Do not open subagents** unless the task is large and genuinely parallel. They re-read
  everything and burn tokens.
- **Do not run workflows or deep research** unless asked for by name.
- **Do not publish artifacts.**
- **Commit'ler ve PR'lar depo sahibinin adına gidiyor.** `Co-Authored-By: Claude`
  ve `Claude-Session:` satırları **eklenmeyecek**; git yazarı da konteynerin
  varsayılanı (`Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`) değil, deponun sahibi olacak.
  Konteyner her oturumda sıfırlandığı için ilk commit'ten önce ayarlayın:
  `git config user.name Akadirr1 && git config user.email akadirr41@gmail.com`.
- **Force push gerekiyorsa ÖNCE söyleyin.** Geçmişi yeniden yazmak (yazar
  değiştirmek dâhil) SHA'ları değiştiriyor ve karşı taraf `git pull` dediğinde
  "ıraksak dallar" hatası alıyor. Bir kez uyarısız yapıldı; kurtarma komutu
  `git reset --hard origin/<dal>` ama bunu önceden bilmek gerekiyor.
- **Do not work around the environment's network policy.** If something is unreachable,
  say it is unreachable. Never assert an outcome you did not observe.
- **Keys:** only publishable/anon keys reach the app; service-role and Supabase secret
  keys never do. **Both `.env` and `.env.local` are gitignored** — the line that called
  `.env` "committed" was wrong, and nothing has ever been committed to it. Either file
  is safe; `.env.local` wins where they overlap, matching Expo. Server-side entry points
  go through `scripts/load-env.ts`, because `import 'dotenv/config'` reads only `.env`
  and silently ignores `.env.local`.
- **An assertion that cannot fail is worse than no assertion** — it reports green. When
  you add a check, break the thing it guards and watch it go red before trusting it.
- Add `check:*` scripts to `package.json` when the first regression appears, not before,
  and start with the assertion that catches that regression.

## Dağıtım yüzeyleri — her değişiklik bunlardan birine düşüyor

Bu depo **tek bir şey yayınlamıyor**, dört ayrı yere dağıtılıyor, ve bir
değişikliğin hangisine düştüğü koda bakınca belli olmuyor. Operatör yanlış
yerde ararsa "yaptım ama çalışmıyor" diyor — bu defterde aynı sınıfta üç kayıt
zaten var (yayınlanmamış kurallar, draft kalan Play sürümü, deploy edilmemiş
panel).

**Kural: kod değiştiren her cevap, hangi yüzeye dokunduğunu ve o yüzeyin ne
istediğini yazacak.** Dokunulmayan yüzeyler de "gerekmiyor" diye geçilecek;
sessizlik "gerekmiyor" anlamına gelmiyor.

| Yüzey | Dosyalar | Ne gerekiyor | Kullanıcıya ne zaman ulaşır |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Mobil uygulama** | `app/`, `src/`, `app.json`, uygulama bağımlılıkları | EAS derlemesi + mağaza sürümü | Mağaza yayınlayınca — güncelleme almayan kullanıcıda eski sürüm kalır |
| **Panel (backend)** | `admin/`, `nixpacks.toml`, panel ortam değişkenleri | Coolify'da **redeploy** | Deploy biter bitmez |
| **Firestore kuralları** | `firestore.rules` | `npm run rules:deploy` | Yayınlanır yayınlanmaz — **deploy'dan bağımsız** |
| **Yalnızca depo** | `docs/`, `scripts/check-*`, `AGENTS.md`, testler | hiçbir şey | hiç |

İki tuzak, ikisi de yaşandı:

- **Ortam değişkeni değiştirmek de deploy istiyor.** Coolify'da değeri yazıp
  kaydetmek koşan konteyneri değiştirmiyor; `process.env` süreç başlarken
  okunuyor. Panel açılış satırında hangi modda olduğunu yazıyor, oraya bakın.
- **Kurallar deploy'a binmiyor.** `firestore.rules` panelle birlikte gitmiyor,
  Firestore onu projeden okuyor. Panel deploy edilmiş olması kuralların
  yayınlandığı anlamına gelmez.

## Load-bearing decisions — the why log

When a non-obvious bug is fixed, the **reason** goes here next to the rule, not just the
fix. The test: would a session with no memory of this one make the same mistake? If yes,
it belongs here. **A mistake made twice has earned a line in this file.**

- The graphify package is `graphifyy` — **two y's** — while the command is `graphify`,
  one y. Get it wrong and `uv tool install` fails silently and `/graphify` never appears.
- `graphify install` is a **separate step** from installing the package. The package
  provides the binary; that command is what registers the skill with the session.
- `$HOME/.local/bin` must be on `PATH` or the install succeeds and the command is still
  not found. The hook appends it to `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` so later shells inherit it.

### From the 1.1.0 release

- `ios.deploymentTarget` is a **minimum**, not a maximum. It was once set to `18.7.8`
  under a commit titled "lower iOS deployment target", which would have limited the App
  Store listing to devices running 18.7.8 or newer. Leave it unset unless there is a
  specific reason; the SDK default is the right answer.
- **A comment describing behaviour is not behaviour.** `Registration.synced` carried
  "`syncPending()` retries these" for months. `syncPending` had never been written —
  grep found the name in that one comment and nowhere else, and offline registrations
  were silently lost. When a comment names a function, check that it exists.
- Taking demo data out of `defaultState` does **not** take it off anyone's device. It is
  already in AsyncStorage on every install that ran the old build, so removing seeded
  state needs a migration in the hydration path too.
- `npx expo prebuild` rewrites `package.json` scripts to `expo run:android` / `expo
  run:ios` **every time it runs**. This project builds on EAS, not locally — revert
  those two lines after any prebuild.
- `android.blockedPermissions` does not delete the permission from the generated
  manifest; it adds `tools:node="remove"` and the Android manifest merger drops it at
  build time. Grepping the source manifest will show the permission still present and
  look like a failure. Check for the marker, not the absence of the line.
- `eas` commands act on the directory you are standing in. `eas project:info` prints the
  EAS project, not the bundle identifier — the identifier lives in `app.json` and is
  never configured in EAS. Confirm the project before any command that writes state;
  running one in the wrong repo targets a different app entirely.
- A notification icon renders at 24dp. The full three-line club wordmark turns to grey
  mush at that size; only the `KOÜ` line survives. Generate candidates and downscale
  them before choosing — this is not judgeable at full resolution.
- **In `startsAt` the wall-clock fields are the meaning; the offset is only carried.**
  `buildEvent` reads `2026-03-12T18:00` literally and derives every visible string from
  it, so the offset never reaches the screen. When the admin form became date + time
  pickers, `splitLocal` first *converted* a stored `…T15:00:00Z` to its +03:00 instant —
  which looks obviously right and silently changed the time the calendar showed. Split
  literally, restamp `+03:00` on save: nothing visible moves and the reminder stops
  firing at a different moment than the one on screen. The check that catches this is
  "değiştirmeden kaydet oynatmıyor" in `check:schema` — it builds an event, splits it,
  rebuilds it and compares every derived field.
- The panel's form CSS listed input types by hand (`input[type=text], input[type=password]`),
  so `date`, `time` and `number` fell through to browser defaults and sat visibly smaller
  than everything around them. It is now `input:not([type=checkbox])` — enumerate the
  exception, not the members.
- **`firestore.rules` in the repo does nothing.** Firestore reads its rules from the
  project, not from git, so an unpublished file leaves the Firestore default in force —
  and that default denies everything. The app said `Missing or insufficient permissions`
  while the rules file sat there looking correct, which it was. `service-account.json`
  is unrelated: it is the panel's Admin SDK key, and the app never touches it — the app
  is an unauthenticated client and the rules are the only thing standing between it and
  the data. Publish with `npm run rules:deploy`; no local check can tell you what is
  live, only that a rule was written at all.
- **The archive was never separate data.** `ArchiveEntry` was `{title, date, cat, year,
  count}` — every field except `count` already existed on `ClubEvent`, so a second
  collection meant entering the same real event twice and letting the two drift. It is
  now the past half of one `events` list (`splitByDate`), and `count` turned out to be a
  *photo* count, not attendance.
- **When a number is on screen, find the thing that produces it.** The archive header
  read "2023'ten bugüne 38 etkinlik · 412 fotoğraf" and each card claimed "24 foto",
  behind a four-photo lightbox. There is no photo storage anywhere in this app — all
  four slots were the same gradient placeholder and 412 counted nothing. Fiction with a
  UI around it is much harder to spot than fiction in a variable.
- **A retry is only safe if every write in it is idempotent.** `pushRegistration` was
  fixed to `setDoc(registrations/{regId})` so a resend lands on the same document — and
  then the seat count was almost added as `increment(1)` in the same batch, which would
  have reopened the identical hole one field over: the batch is atomic, but a resend
  after a lost `synced` flag runs it again. The count is a list of registration ids
  written with `arrayUnion`, which ignores an id it already holds.
- A Firestore rule that denies `create` on a document the client writes with
  `set(..., {merge: true})` does not degrade — it fails the whole write. `eventSeats`
  docs are born in the panel, but an event predating them would have had *no* student
  able to register, so the rule allows a first-seat create against an existing event.
- **A document id can carry a uniqueness rule that no query can.** One student number
  per event is enforced by making the registration's id `eventId__studentNo`: a second
  device writing the same student hits an existing document, and the rule only lets a
  write through that changes nothing but `createdAt`. No count, no read, nothing to race
  against — but the id is now personal data, so what goes in the public seat list is a
  separate random token.
- `set()` on a document that already exists is an **update** to Firestore rules, not a
  create. `allow create` alone therefore rejects the very retry that `setDoc` exists to
  make safe, and the registration retries forever getting denied every time. The narrow
  `affectedKeys().hasOnly(['createdAt'])` update branch is what lets an identical resend
  through while still refusing a different one.
- **Only retry what a retry can fix.** `permission-denied` is a rules decision and will
  be the same next launch, so it stops the background retry and surfaces a manual one
  instead of burning a write per app open behind a "Gönderiliyor…" that never resolves.
- Grepping `firestore.rules` as one string finds a line in *some* block, not the block
  you meant. Deleting the retry branch from `registrations` left the check green because
  `raffleEntries` still had the identical line — `rulesBlock()` in `check:release` slices
  one block out before matching.
- **Firebase Cloud Storage costs money on any project created after 2024** — the
  default bucket needs Blaze, and the config's `storageBucket` value is a computed name
  that appears whether or not a bucket exists. Event photos live in Supabase Storage
  instead; Firestore stays where it is. The app never touched a storage SDK — it renders
  a URL — so swapping providers was one file.
- **A release build has no console.** `isFirebaseConfigured` being false is always a
  broken build — `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` is inlined at build time, so a missing EAS environment
  variable means the app connects to nothing. It only logged, so the app opened empty
  and silent; in a store build there is no way to see why. It sets `error` now, which
  puts `ContentNotice` on screen.
- EAS environment variables belong to an environment (production/preview/development).
  Every build profile in `eas.json` names its `environment` explicitly rather than
  relying on a default — the failure mode of guessing wrong is a store build with no
  configuration at all.
- **Metro's transform cache survives an `.env` change.** Measuring whether
  `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` values are inlined gave "not in the bundle" three times, because
  earlier exports in the same session had run with no `.env` and the transformed module
  was cached. `npx expo export --clear` reversed the answer. Any measurement of what a
  build contains has to clear the cache first, or it measures an older build.
- **`.env.local` is an Expo convention, not a dotenv one.** `import 'dotenv/config'`
  loads `.env` and nothing else, so a key placed exactly where the docs said belongs
  produced no error at all — just an undefined variable and a panel that did not work.
  `scripts/load-env.ts` loads `.env.local` then `.env`; dotenv does not overwrite what
  is already set, so first-loaded wins.
- **One failed read inside `Promise.all` blacks out everything beside it.** `fetchContent`
  fetched events, raffles and `eventSeats` together; the seat rule was not published yet,
  so the whole app opened empty with "Missing or insufficient permissions" while the
  events were perfectly readable. Seat counts are an enrichment — they are fetched
  separately now and their failure only costs the remaining-seat line.
- A publishable Supabase key in the panel's secret slot fails as
  `row-level security policy`, which never names the actual cause. The key type is
  visible in the value itself — `sb_publishable_` prefix, or `role: anon` in a legacy
  JWT payload — so the panel refuses before the first request instead of relaying a
  message about policies.
- **An error branch you never triggered is a branch you never wrote.** The panel's
  "Storage bucket not found" message matched `err.code === 404`; gaxios 6 puts the
  number in `err.status` and leaves `code` unset, so the branch never ran and the
  operator kept seeing the generic page. It was written from the shape of the error I
  assumed, never from one I had seen. `check:panel` now carries the real object out of a
  panel log — the same way `check:html` carries real announcement bodies.
- **A field the form stops showing is a field the form stops sending.** The archive
  form hides capacity and the badge because they mean nothing for an event that
  already happened — and saving would then have wiped both. They are rendered as
  hidden inputs instead, and `check:panel` asserts the values survive.
- **Upload after validating, never before.** A rejected form that has already written
  its files leaves objects in Storage that no event points at — quota is paid for them
  and nobody ever notices. The panel validates, then uploads, and deletes what it
  uploaded if the second build fails.
- `makePublic()` throws on a bucket with uniform bucket-level access, which new Firebase
  projects turn on by default. The download URL with a `firebaseStorageDownloadTokens`
  metadata value works under both settings and does not make the bucket listable.
- A multer `fileFilter` that answers `cb(null, false)` **drops the file silently**: the
  event saves, the operator believes the photo uploaded, and it is nowhere. Pass an
  error instead, and translate multer's codes — an unexplained "Bir şeyler ters gitti"
  after picking seven photos tells the operator nothing.
- **A check that reads comments finds its own rationale.** A guard has now gone red
  against correct code three times because the comment explaining *why* something was
  removed still contains its name — `addDoc`, `increment(1)`, `HOLD_MS`. Strip comments
  before matching source; `check:release` has a `strip()` for exactly this.
- The calendar/archive boundary is **the day, not the instant**. Splitting on the start
  time would move a three-hour event into the archive while it is still running; an
  event stays on the calendar through its own day and moves the next morning. `today`
  comes from `todayLocal`, which reads +03:00 rather than the device clock — a phone
  abroad otherwise archives an event the club still has on today's calendar.
- **`newArchEnabled` was removed from the SDK 57 config schema.** It was valid in 52–53
  and did nothing here — the new architecture is the only one in 57, so the flag turned
  on something already on. A no-op field is invisible until the schema check calls it an
  additional property and fails the EAS build. `check:release` greps `app.json` for it.
- **A version guard's authority is the *installed* `expo`.** Expected versions come from
  `node_modules/expo/bundledNativeModules.json`, so a stale `expo` ships a stale list and
  the guard goes green against yesterday's expectations — locally it passed while
  `expo doctor` on EAS listed eleven mismatches, because the local `expo` was 57.0.12 and
  doctor compared against 57.0.17's list. `expo` is not in its own list, so it is pinned
  separately against the installed version.
- `npx expo install --check` needs api.expo.dev and **the container's proxy blocks it**
  (`HTTP Proxy Network Error: Forbidden`). That is not a reason to type version numbers
  by hand — the npm registry itself is reachable, and api.expo.dev was never where the
  answer lived: every `expo` release carries the list it expects in its own
  `bundledNativeModules.json`. `npm run deps:sync` reads the newest patch of the current
  SDK major from the registry, installs it, then writes that release's list into
  `package.json`. Expo's own major stays put: 57 → 58 is a migration, not a patch bump.
  Run it whenever `paket sürümleri SDK ile uyuşuyor` goes red.
- **A tool that reads its expectations from disk must prove what it read.**
  `deps:sync` takes the expected versions from the installed `expo`'s
  `bundledNativeModules.json`. `git pull` updates `package.json` and leaves
  `node_modules` alone — so the first thing it did on a freshly pulled checkout was
  read *yesterday's* list and rewrite eleven correct versions **backwards**. The fix is
  not a warning: it verifies the installed `expo` is the target before opening the
  list, installs it if not, and re-checks afterwards. The same trap made
  `check:release` print `~57.0.15 ≠ ~57.0.10`, which reads as "the new version is
  wrong"; it now reports the stale `node_modules` instead and says `npm ci`.
- **Every check ran against a tree where `node_modules` already matched.** That is the
  one state a dependency-sync tool never finds in the wild — after a pull, after a
  branch switch, on a colleague's first clone, `node_modules` is behind by definition.
  Test the state the user is actually in, not the state you happen to be in.
- **A successful upload is not a delivered build.** `eas.json` carried
  `submit.production.android.releaseStatus: "draft"`, and a draft release sits in Play
  Console without being distributed to any track — `eas submit` reports success, the
  build is genuinely there, and every tester on the internal track sees "öğe
  bulunamadı". Play needs draft for the *first* upload of an app that has never had a
  release; leaving it there afterwards is a test channel with no testers. `check:release`
  now refuses it, so turning it back on has to be deliberate.
- **TestFlight's "the requested app is not available or doesn't exist" is an App Store
  Connect availability fact, not a build fact.** The EAS xcodebuild log settles the
  build side on its own: `ARCHIVE SUCCEEDED`, zero errors, `beta-reports-active = 1`
  (an entitlement only App Store distribution profiles carry), no `ProvisionedDevices`
  (so not ad-hoc), `get-task-allow = 0`, minimum iOS 15.1. A binary that signs like that
  cannot be the reason a tester cannot install it. Do not go looking in `app.json` —
  export compliance is already answered there, and it produces a "Missing Compliance"
  banner, not this error.
  The reported cause that matches the signature — *visible in TestFlight, notification
  arrives, install fails instantly* — is the app's **Pricing and Availability →
  App Availability** left with countries in `Processing`, which is account-shaped: it
  hits every app at once and survives new builds, which is why it looks like a build
  problem and is not one.
  **But an amber clock on that page is not by itself that state.** The summary shows
  `🕐 1 Available / 🕐 174 Not Available`, which reads like something pending; opening
  the detail shows the per-country status is `Available on App Release`, and that is the
  correct, settled state for an app whose first version has not shipped yet. Reading the
  summary clock as "stuck processing" cost a wrong diagnosis here and nearly cost the
  operator a pointless change to their deliberate single-country setting. Judge it from
  the per-country status, never from the clock. Narrowing availability is also not a
  testing problem in itself: TestFlight has no territory restriction, a tester in any
  territory is eligible. Next is Agreements, Tax and Banking pending account-wide.
  Beyond that it is a known Apple-side bug that only Developer Support clears.
  **Unverified from this repo:** none of it can be observed here — `eas-cli` has no
  credentials in the container and App Store Connect has no read path. Treat the above
  as where to look, not as a diagnosis, and never assert which one it was.
- **EAS's remote version counter and Play's used-code list are two separate ledgers.**
  With `appVersionSource: "remote"`, `autoIncrement` bumps a number EAS keeps for the
  project — initialised from the local config and updated only by EAS builds. It has no
  idea what Play already holds. So a fresh build can auto-increment perfectly and still
  land on a `versionCode` Play has seen, and the error reads as though autoIncrement had
  failed when it did exactly what it promises. `eas build:version:get --platform android`
  shows the counter; `eas build:version:set` moves it above what the store holds. A
  rebuild alone does not fix a counter that is behind — it just burns another number.
- **`releaseStatus` lives in `submit`, so changing it does not need a new build.** The
  artifact is unaffected by anything under `eas.json` → `submit`; only `eas submit` reads
  it. When that setting stranded a build as a draft in Play, the fix was to publish the
  draft already uploaded there (Internal testing → the draft → review → roll out), not
  to rebuild. Saying "the config only affects future submits" invited exactly the
  unnecessary build it was meant to prevent — say which command reads a setting, not
  just when it takes effect.
- **Deploying the panel needs `nixpacks.toml`, and both lines in it are load-bearing.**
  Nixpacks recognises this repo as a Node app and would run `npm start` — which here is
  `expo start`, the mobile dev server. The panel would never come up and the deploy
  would still report success. And the panel's runtime packages (`express`,
  `firebase-admin`, `multer`, `sharp`, `@supabase/supabase-js`, `tsx`) sit in
  `devDependencies`, which is right for the mobile side — Metro never reaches them — but
  the lockfile marks all seven `dev: true`, so an install under `NODE_ENV=production`
  (what Nixpacks sets) skips every one. Both failures land in the same place: the build
  goes green and the container dies on boot with `Cannot find module 'express'`.
  `check:release` fails if either the `--include=dev` or the start command disappears.
- **A session cookie without `Secure` is the deploy turning a local convenience into an
  exposure.** The panel ran on `localhost` for months, where `Secure` would have
  prevented login outright — browsers do not store it over plain HTTP. Put the same
  panel behind Coolify and it holds student names and numbers on the open internet.
  The flag is decided per request from `req.secure`, which needs `trust proxy` because
  a reverse proxy terminates TLS and forwards plain HTTP. `cookieHeader` lives in its
  own module for one reason: importing `server.ts` starts `app.listen`, so nothing in
  it can be asserted without standing a server up.
- **`strip()` knows `//` and `/* */`; `nixpacks.toml` is commented in `#`.** The guard
  above read the raw TOML — and that file explains, in its own comments, both of the
  strings it searches for. Delete the real `--include=dev` and the whole `[start]`
  block, leave the prose describing them, and the check still passed: verified, it did.
  Same trap as the JS one already in this log, one file format over, and it fails the
  more dangerous way round — green against a config that cannot boot. It strips `#` to
  end of line now, counting quotes first, because a `#` inside a command is not a
  comment and truncating there would fail a correct file.
- **`??` does not catch an empty environment variable, and a deploy panel makes empty
  the easy mistake.** `Number(process.env.ADMIN_PORT ?? process.env.PORT ?? 4000)` reads
  0 when `ADMIN_PORT` exists and is blank — `''` is not nullish, so the fallback never
  runs, and `Number('')` is 0. `listen(0)` is not an error: the kernel hands out a random
  free port, the container reports healthy, the log is clean, and the reverse proxy never
  reaches it. This repo's own `.env.example` ships `ADMIN_PORT=` empty under a comment
  promising 4000, so the documented path produced the broken case. The decision lives in
  `resolvePort` (`admin/port.ts`) now — blank, non-numeric, zero and out-of-range all
  fall through — and `check:release` asserts `server.ts` still goes through it, because a
  pure function nobody calls guards nothing.
- **`@types/*` is not auto-included here, so a test runner's globals are invisible
  to `tsc`.** Adding Jest made `typecheck` fail with `Cannot find name 'describe'`
  in every test file while `@types/jest` sat correctly installed in
  `node_modules/@types`. TypeScript normally pulls those in automatically when
  `types` is unspecified, and this config never restricted it — but `tsc
  --listFiles` showed only the `@types` packages something *imports* (express,
  multer, react), never a global one. Whatever `expo/tsconfig.base` does with
  `moduleResolution: bundler` and `customConditions`, the measured behaviour is
  that automatic inclusion does not happen; naming `"types": ["jest"]` fixes it
  and cannot lose anything, because nothing was being auto-included to begin with.
  Diagnose this with `--listFiles`, not by re-reading the config: the config
  looks correct and is not.
- **`@testing-library/react-native` 14 made `render`, `rerender` and `unmount`
  async.** Ported tests written for 13 call them bare, and the failure names
  nothing useful: `render` returns a promise, `screen` is still unbound, and the
  next line throws "`render` function has not been called". Worse is the
  unawaited `unmount()`: the test that forgot it passes, and the *next* test in
  the file fails instead, because cleanup lands in the middle of its render.
  That one cost the longest — the failing test passed in isolation, which is the
  signal to stop reading the failing test and start reading the one before it.
- **A seven-day `gcTime` is a seven-day timer, and Jest waits for it.** After the
  suite went green, `jest` never exited: every test that mounted a real
  `QueryClient` left one `setTimeout` per query, sized to `gcTime`, which
  `createQueryClient` sets to the offline retention window.
  `--detectOpenHandles` reports nothing, because nothing leaked — an ordinary
  pending timer is not a leak. The tell is that a minimal render test exits
  fine while the provider one hangs. Tests own the client they mount and
  `clear()` it afterwards; `--forceExit` would have hidden it and, with it,
  every future real leak.
- **`rescheduleReminders` cancels every scheduled notification, so a second
  scheduler is a silent delete.** The AI Gündem digest needed a daily local
  notification, and adding it as its own scheduler would have worked in
  isolation and failed in place: the next reminder rebuild calls
  `cancelAllScheduledNotificationsAsync()` and takes the digest with it. No
  error, no log — a notification that simply stops arriving, which nobody
  reports as a bug because nobody knows it was due. What gets scheduled is now
  decided in one pure function (`src/notificationPlan.ts`) and the effectful
  half only applies the list.
- **Quiet hours may move a reminder and must not move the digest.** Nobody chose
  03:00 for a reminder — it fell there from the event's own start time — so
  shifting it to 08:00 is a service. The digest hour is picked by hand on the
  settings screen, and moving it means a notification arriving at a time the
  settings screen does not show. Same class as the calendar entry above: the
  wall-clock the user set is the meaning.
- **A hand-written time range in the UI drifts from the constant that enforces
  it.** The notification screen said "23:00 – 09:00 arası bildirim yok" while
  `QUIET_END_HOUR` was 8, so the setting described its own behaviour an hour
  wrong — and nothing could catch it, because the string and the constant never
  met. The label is built from the constants now. Anywhere a screen states a
  number the code also decides, derive it; a copy of a value is a value that
  will disagree.
- **A new dependency turns `git pull` into a broken checkout, and Metro's error
  blames the wrong thing.** After the `@tanstack` packages landed, a fresh pull
  and `npx expo start` failed with `Unable to resolve
  "@tanstack/query-async-storage-persister"` — which reads as "the package is
  missing from the repo", not "your node_modules is behind". It was declared in
  `package.json` and in the lockfile the whole time. The rule "npm ci after a
  pull" was already in this file and still did not help, because nothing checked
  it: `check:release` now lists every declared package that is absent from
  `node_modules` and says `npm ci` outright. Reproduced by deleting exactly that
  package before adding the guard.
- **A ported comment asserting a runtime capability is not evidence the runtime
  has it.** `deviceId.ts` arrived saying `crypto.getRandomValues` is what
  "React Native, Hermes and every browser provide", and on a real device it does
  not exist — the app logged the fallback on every launch and both the device id
  and the Edge idempotency key came from `Math.random()`. Neither needs to be
  secret; both need to be unique, and colliding ids merge two devices into one
  rate-limit bucket. `expo-crypto` is in the SDK's own version list and needs no
  extra native module. When ported code claims a global exists, check the
  runtime, not the comment.
- **A zeroed random source produces a perfectly valid uuid.** With
  `expo-crypto` stubbed (as it is under Jest), `getRandomValues` returns all
  zeros and `randomUuidV4` yields `00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000000` — which
  passes the v4 shape check, so `isDeviceId` approves it and every install gets
  the SAME identity. The generator now rejects an all-zero draw. The test that
  caught it was already there, asserting only that two ids differ.
- **A client's poll window has to be longer than the server's scheduling
  period.** The enrichment hook polled six times at five seconds and gave up
  after thirty, while the summarisation worker runs on a two-minute cron — so it
  quit before the worker had run even once, and the log said "still queued (no
  reason given)" because there was no reason: the job was waiting its turn.
  Widening a window is done by spacing the polls, not by adding them; each poll
  writes to a per-device rate-limit bucket. The window is asserted against the
  cron period now, and that assertion caught its own arithmetic being wrong
  before the code shipped.
- **`btoa`, `atob` and `Buffer` are all absent under Hermes, and code that
  falls back from one to the other assumes a world with only two runtimes.**
  `cursor.ts` read `typeof btoa === 'function' ? btoa(...) : Buffer.from(...)`,
  which says "browser, else Node". Expo SDK 57 on RN 0.86 is neither: grep the
  whole `react-native` and `expo` trees and nothing installs any of the three.
  Jest hid it perfectly, because Jest *is* Node and always took the second
  branch. The test that catches it deletes the three globals before calling —
  that is the only way to put a Node test runner in the device's world.
- **A regex character class written as `[^a-z0-9]` does not case-fold Turkish,
  it deletes it.** `tileFromSlug` stripped with `/[^a-z0-9]/gi` and then called
  `toUpperCase()`. Measured: `İTÜ Yapay Zekâ` produced the badge `"TY"` — the
  `İ` and `Ü` were removed and the letters that survived came from two different
  words — and `şirket-blog` produced `"IR"`. Testing "is this a letter" by
  asking whether its upper and lower forms differ is engine-independent and
  needs no unicode property escapes, which Hermes does not support reliably.
- **The +03:00 rule belongs to the app, not to the events screen.** The port
  rendered its day line and article dates from `new Date().getDay()` and friends,
  so a phone outside Türkiye showed AI Gündem naming one day while the Takvim
  tab named another, at the same instant. `clubCalendar` now sits beside
  `todayLocal` and both sections read it. Related: "dün" is a calendar word, so
  it is computed from calendar days at +03:00, not from elapsed milliseconds —
  47 elapsed hours can be two calendar days.

### AI Gündem portundan — bir çalışma zamanı, bir de kendi testine saklanan hatalar

- **React Native'in `URL`'i bir ayrıştırıcı değil, bir dize sarmalayıcısı.** Taban
  verilmediğinde girdiyi hiç denetlemeden saklıyor, yani **hiçbir zaman
  fırlatmıyor** — `new URL(raw)` etrafındaki `catch` erişilemez kod. Ölçüldü:
  `addSourceByUrl`'e verilen beş girdinin beşi de `unsupported_source` döndü,
  `https://ornek.com/rss?redirect=https://a:b@c.com` dâhil. `invalid_input`
  dalına hiç girilmiyordu; `protocol` getter'ı şemasız girdide `''` döndüğü için
  "yalnızca https" cevabı çıkıyordu, ve `password` getter'ı
  (`/https?:\/\/.*:(.*)@/`, açgözlü `.*`) yetki bölümünün dışını da tarayıp
  sorgu dizesindeki bir `@`yi kimlik bilgisi sanıyordu. Bir de çökme var:
  `new URL('a#b')` yapıcının içinde `undefined.includes` çağırıyor. Doğrulama
  artık `src/gundem/data-access/sourceUrl.ts`'te, elle: girdi bir dize, çıktı bir
  karar, motor bilgisi girmiyor. **Tarayıcıda ve Node'da doğru olan bir şey
  burada doğru değil — ve Jest Node olduğu için testler bunu göstermiyor.**
- **Yazılmış ama bağlanmamış bir fonksiyon hiçbir şeyi korumuyor; kendi testi
  varsa daha da kötü.** `capPersistedFeed` çevrimdışı önbelleğe 200 haberlik
  sınırı uyguluyordu — kâğıt üzerinde. İki ayrı sebeple uygulamıyordu:
  `dehydrateOptions`ta yalnızca `shouldDehydrateQuery` vardı (kimse çağırmıyordu)
  **ve** fonksiyon `page.data.items`e bakıyordu, oysa gerçek sayfa
  `Page<Article>`, yani `{items, nextCursor, hasMore}`. Birim testinin fikstürü
  de aynı uydurma şekli kuruyordu, o yüzden yeşildi. Grafik sorgusu buldu:
  *"kaynak dosyalarda tanımlı, ama dosya-dışı tek göndergesi kendi testi olan"*
  çağrılabilirler. Sonuç sınırsız büyüyen bir AsyncStorage blob'uydu.
  **Bir testin fikstürü tipten gelmiyorsa, test kodu değil kendini doğruluyor
  olabilir.**
- **Kısma (throttle) bir testi sahte yeşile boyar.** Kalıcılaştırıcı iki saniyede
  bir yazıyor; "blob'da 200'den fazla haber yok" iddiası, `waitFor` ilk anlık
  görüntüyü gördüğü an geçiyordu — o görüntüde zaten 20 haber vardı. Sınır hiç
  uygulanmasa da geçen bir iddia. `persistOptionsFor()` bileşenin dışına alındı,
  test artık `dehydrate()`i sağlayıcının kullandığı seçeneklerle doğrudan
  çağırıyor. **Zamanlayıcının arkasından ölçülen bir sayı, ölçmek istediğiniz
  sayı değildir.**
- **`toLowerCase()` Türkçeyi, `toLocaleLowerCase('tr')` İngilizceyi kaçırıyor —
  ve son arama listesinde ikisi birden var.** Düz küçültme `İstanbul` ile
  `istanbul`u ayırıyor (birleşen nokta); Türkçe küçültme `OpenAI`yi `openaı`
  yapıp `openai`den ayırıyor. Türkçeye geçince mevcut `OpenAI` testi kırmızı
  verdi — deponun kendi kuralını körü körüne uygulamanın bedeli. Kural artık tek
  cümle: **I harfinin noktası bu listede bir arama farkı değil**; dördü de düz
  `i`ye katlanıyor (`searchKey`).
- **Aynı kararı iki yerde uygulamak, ikisinin ayrışmasının tek sebebidir.**
  `pushRecentSearch` listeyi 10'da kesiyordu, `useRecentSearches`'ün iyimser
  kopyası kesmiyordu: ekranda 15 arama, diskte 10, ve fark ancak uygulama
  yeniden açılınca görünüyor. İki taraf da tek bir saf `mergeRecentSearch`
  çağırıyor artık. İkisini ayrı ayrı sınayan iki test bu farkı asla göremez —
  farkı gören test ikisini **aynı** testte karşılaştıran testtir.
- **`.catch`i olmayan bir `.then`, bitmeyen bir iskelet demek.** `useLoaded`
  reddedilen bir okumada `isReady`yi sonsuza kadar `false` bırakıyordu: hata
  yok, log yok, yalnızca yüklenmeyen bir liste — üstüne yakalanmamış bir promise
  reddi. Bugün `kv.ts` her okumayı yuttuğu için dal tetiklenmiyor, ama
  tetiklenmeyen bir dal yazılmamış bir daldır.
- **Bir yorumun adıyla andığı dosyanın var olduğunu kontrol edin.** `hooks.ts`
  aylarca "Measured with the fake PostgREST in `src/__tests__/integration.test.tsx`"
  diyordu; o dosya yoktu. Bu defterde zaten aynısının bir örneği var
  (`syncPending`). Dosya artık var ve o ölçümü gerçekten yapıyor.
- **Grafiği kurarken `docs/` ve `*.md` dışarıda bırakılırsa maliyet sıfır.**
  Semantik çıkarım alt ajan istiyor; AST yarısı istemiyor. Mimari sorular için
  AST yarısı yeterli: yukarıdaki "yalnızca kendi testi çağırıyor" bulgusu bir
  grafik sorgusu, dosya taraması değil.

  **Düğüm sayısı bir anlık görüntü, beklenti değil** — kod eklendikçe artıyor,
  ve kaç çıkacağı dışlamalara bağlı. İki ölçüm, ikisi de gerçek:

  | ne zaman | nasıl | sonuç |
  |---|---|---|
  | ilk kayıt | `/graphify .`, kod-only, dışlamalar uygulanmış | 111 dosya → 1005 düğüm, 2272 kenar |
  | 2026-09 | `graphify update .`, **dışlama yok** | 152 dosya → 1423 düğüm, 3306 kenar |

  İki sayı doğrudan karşılaştırılamaz: ikinci koşum `design-source/` ve
  `.claude/skills/*`'ı da içeri aldı, ki bu defterin birkaç satır yukarısı
  onları dışarıda tutmak gerektiğini söylüyor. Yani bir rakam bu tablodakinden
  büyük çıktığında önce "hangi dışlamalarla koşturuldu" diye sorun — kod büyümüş
  de olabilir, dışlama unutulmuş da.

  Maliyeti ölçüldü: **13 sn (soğuk) / 2 sn (sıcak), sıfır LLM çağrısı, 3.2 MB.**
  `graphify update` saf AST çıkarımı — token yemiyor. Grafiği git'te saklamayı
  düşünmeden önce bu satırı okuyun: saklanacak şeyin maliyeti 13 saniye, ve
  `graphify-out/` gitignore'da olmasının sebebi bu dosyanın üstünde yazıyor.

### Cihazdan gelen "çeviri gelmiş ama özet oluşturamıyor" raporundan

- **Bir cevap, elde olan veriyi silemez — en fazla ona ekleyebilir.** Makale
  ekranı "Özet hazırlanıyor" kararını `request-enrichment`'ın cevabına bakarak
  veriyordu: `pending = result?.status === 'queued' || ...`. Satırda üç madde
  dururken uç noktadan gelen bir `queued`, onları dönen bir göstergenin
  arkasında yok ediyordu. Kullanıcının gördüğü tam olarak buydu — çeviri
  ekranda (yani `summary_ready` doğru, yani özet de satırda), özet yok.
  Ekran artık önce **elindekine** bakıyor: `hasSummary(summary)` doğruysa ne
  `pending` ne `unavailable` yazabilir.
- **Bir durum dizesini tanımamak, veriyi atmak için sebep değil.** Depo yalnızca
  `status === 'ready'` gövdesini kabul ediyordu; sunucu özeti başka bir adla
  döndürdüğü an (`already_enriched`, `done`, ne olduğunu buradan göremiyoruz)
  üç madde çöpe gidiyor ve cevap "kuyrukta" oluyordu. Koşul artık şekle bakıyor:
  gövde dolu `summary.bullets` taşıyorsa cevap odur. `unavailable` yine önce
  kontrol ediliyor — sunucu bakıp "gövde yok" dediyse boş bir `summary` alanı
  bunu bozmamalı.
- **Özet ve çeviri iki ayrı üründür; `toSummary` onları birbirine bağlıyordu.**
  `summary_ready` false ise fonksiyon erken dönüp `translationTr: null`
  diyordu — satır bitmiş bir çeviri taşısa bile. Çeviri durumu artık metnin
  kendisinden okunuyor, bayraktan değil: elde Türkçe metin varsa hazırdır.
  Ters yönü de düzeldi — `translation_state: 'ready'` derken metin boşken
  düğme açılıyor, kullanıcı basıyor ve `bodyFor` sessizce orijinale düşüyordu.
- **Teşhis edilemeyen bir uyarı, uyarı değil.** Cihaz logunda sekiz satır vardı
  ve sekizi de aynı cümleydi: "returned an unrecognised body". Sunucunun ne
  döndürdüğünü hiçbiri taşımıyordu, dolayısıyla log elde olduğu hâlde sebep
  bilinemiyordu. Uyarı artık HTTP kodunu, `status` alanını ve üst düzey
  anahtarları yazıyor — gövdenin kendisini değil, içinde makale metni olabilir.
- **İki düzeltme aynı anda girince biri diğerinin testini görünmez kılabilir.**
  "Özeti olan haberde hiç sorma" düzeltmesi devreye girince `result` hiç
  oluşmuyor, ve `pending`in eski (yanlış) ifadesi de artık yanlış cevabı
  veremiyor: ekran testleri **eski kodla da** yeşil kalıyordu. Ölçüldü —
  düzeltme geri alındı, üç test de yeşil verdi. Koruyan test, ikisinin
  ayrıştığı sırayı kuran testtir: özet **yokken** aç, `queued` cevabını al,
  sonra satırı tazele. Her düzeltmeyi tek tek geri alıp kırmızıyı görmeden
  "test ettim" demeyin; birlikte geri almak bu maskelemeyi gizler.
- **Bir uç noktanın gövdesini tahmin etmeyin — fonksiyonun kaynağını okuyun.**
  `request-enrichment`'ın `ready` cevabı maddeleri **`summary_tr`** adıyla
  gönderiyor; istemci `summary.bullets` okuyordu. Alan adı tutmadığı için
  sunucunun her başarılı cevabı "tanınmayan gövde" sayılıp `queued`a
  düşüyordu — özet üretilmiş, kablodan geçmiş, istemcide çöpe gitmişti.
  Backend ayrı bir Supabase projesinde ve buraya bağlı değil, ama kodu
  `Akadirr1/follow-ai`'da ve depo herkese açık: `add_repo` + `git clone` ile
  okundu ve soru bir tahminle değil kaynakla kapandı. Bir tur önce "buradan
  bilinemez" demiştim; bilinebiliyordu.
- **Aynı hata kaynak uygulamada da var.** `follow-ai` kendi Edge
  fonksiyonunun gövdesini kendi istemcisinde yanlış okuyor. Taşınan kod
  taşındığı hatayı da taşır: bir portu "sadakatle taşındı" diye doğru
  saymayın — karşı tarafın sözleşmesini bir kez de kendiniz okuyun.
- **İstemci testinin fikstürü, istemcinin varsayımını doğrular.** Bu
  uyuşmazlığın iki uygulamada birden yaşamasının sebebi buydu: `bullets`
  bekleyen kodun testi de `bullets` gönderiyordu, yeşildi ve hiçbir şeyi
  korumuyordu. Kablodaki şekli sınayan fikstür, kablonun **öbür ucundan**
  kopyalanır.
- **Uzun metnin "txt dosyası gibi" görünmesi bir yazı tipi sorunu değil,
  paragrafın hiç olmamasıydı.** Gövde tek bir `<Txt>` olarak basılıyordu; RSS
  çıkarıcıları kimi kaynakta boş satırla, kimisinde tek satır sonuyla ayırıyor
  ve ekran ikisini de olduğu gibi geçiriyordu. `toParagraphs` her iki biçimi de
  tanıyor **ve** boş satır varken paragraf içindeki tek satır sonlarını boşluğa
  katlıyor — katlamazsa metin, sütun genişliğiyle alakasız yerlerden kırılmış
  görünür. Boş satırı hiç olmayan metinde ise tek satır sonu paragraf
  ayırıcısıdır; o dal atlanırsa metnin tamamı tek bir dev paragrafa iner, yani
  düzeltilmeye çalışılan duvarın aynısı kurulur.
- **Okunabilirlik dört sayının işi, biri değil:** punto (14,5 → 16), satır
  aralığı (1,52 → 1,7), satır uzunluğu (kartın 18 px iç boşluğu ~85 karakteri
  ~60'a indiriyor) ve zemin (beyaz kart, sayfa zemininde yüzen metin değil).
  Yalnızca puntoyu büyütmek satırı daha da uzatır ve durumu kötüleştirir.

### Apple'ın çekiliş reddinden — 5.3.1 / 5.3.2

- **Red mekanikte değildi, beyandaydı.** Uygulama zaten çekiliş çekmiyordu:
  `raffleSchema.ts` aylardır "burada rastgele seçim, tohum, durum makinesi yok"
  diye yazıyor ve doğru yazıyor — form toplanıyor, kazanan panelden elle
  giriliyor. Eksik olan tek şey, bunun **kullanıcıya söylenmesiydi**: düzenleyen
  kim, katılım ücretsiz mi, kazanan nasıl seçiliyor, Apple'ın ilgisi var mı.
  Reddi okuyup koda bakınca ilk refleks mantığı değiştirmek oluyor; değiştirilecek
  mantık yoktu. Guideline 5.3.x'in istediği şeylerin çoğu davranış değil metin.
- **Düzenleyen adı, App Store Connect'teki *takım* adıdır — kişisel Apple Account
  adı değil.** Bu hesapta ikisi farklı yazılıyor: hesap sayfasının tepesinde
  `Abdülkadir İvenç`, Team ID'nin üstünde `Abdulkadir IVENC`. Mağazada
  geliştirici olarak görünen ve Apple'ın beyanla karşılaştırdığı ikincisi.
  Türkçe aksanlı hâli daha "doğru" göründüğü için düzeltmek isteniyor; düzeltmek
  tam olarak reddin sebebini geri getirir. Testte `not.toContain('Abdülkadir')`
  var, ve orada olma sebebi bu.
- **Kurallar sayfası yalnızca kodun gerçekten yaptığı şeyi yazabilir.** "Her
  öğrenci numarası bir çekilişe yalnızca bir kez katılabilir" cümlesi yazılmadı:
  o kural *kayıtlarda* doküman kimliğiyle (`eventId__studentNo`) zorlanıyor ama
  çekiliş katılımının kimliği rastgele (`makeEntryId`) — uygulama ikinci
  katılımı yalnızca aynı cihazda engelliyor. Zorlanmayan bir kuralı resmî
  kurallara yazmak, "412 fotoğraf" satırıyla aynı sınıfta bir kurgu olurdu.
- **Bir bileşenin kendi testi, onu kimsenin ekrana koymadığını göremez.**
  `RaffleNotice` render testleriyle birlikte geldi ve o testler beyan iki
  ekrandan da silinse yeşil kalırdı. Mount edildiğini doğrulayan şey
  `check:release` — dördü de tek tek kırılıp kırmızı verdiği görüldü (etkinlik
  ekranı, form, rota kaydı, Apple cümlesinin birebir hâli). Aynı gerekçeyle
  `raffleLegal.ts` okunurken yorumlar atılıyor: cümleyi yalnızca bir açıklama
  satırında bırakmak kontrolü yeşile boyardı.
- **`@testing-library/react-native` 14'te elle `unmount()` çağırmayın — beklenmiş
  olsa bile.** Depodaki eski kayıt "unmount'u beklemeyi unutma" diyor; ölçülen
  doğru bundan farklı. Her testin sonunda `await unmount()` varken dosyadaki ilk
  render geçiyor, sonraki her render **boş ağaç** buluyordu: kurallar sayfası
  testi tek başına (`jest -t`) yeşil, dosyanın tamamıyla kırmızı. Konsolda tek
  ipucu "overlapping act() calls". RNTL 14 kendi `afterEach` temizliğini zaten
  bekletiyor; üstüne elle sökmek çakışan act() kapsamı üretiyor. **Tek başına
  geçip toplu koşuda düşen bir render testinde önce bir önceki testin
  temizliğine bakın.**

### Arka plan zenginleştirmesi ve yapılandırma görünürlüğü

- **Zenginleştirme talep güdümlü, ve bunu kimse yazmamıştı.** `sync-feeds` her
  15 dakikada bir haberleri çekiyor ama **özet işi kuyruğa koymuyor**; işi
  yaratan tek şey bir istemcinin `request-enrichment` çağırması, ve onu işleyen
  worker iki dakikada bir koşuyor. Sonuç: bir haberi **ilk açan kişi her zaman
  bekliyor** — cihazda görülen "Özet hazırlanıyor, bir dakika sonra geldi" tam
  olarak bu, hız sınırı değil. Hız sınırı 429 ve `rate_limited` döner, `queued`
  değil. Karşılığı akış yüklenirken arka planda ısıtmak: özet sunucuda
  `content_hash`'e göre paylaşıldığı için bir cihazın ısıttığı haber herkes için
  hazır oluyor.
- **Ön yükleme bütçesi tahmin edilemez, sunucudan okunur.**
  `_shared/enrichment.ts`: `request_enrichment_miss` **30/cihaz/gün**,
  `request_enrichment_check` **120/cihaz/saat**. Isıtma yalnızca özeti olmayan
  satırlar için yapıldığından her ısıtma bir *miss*. Tavan bu yüzden 12: kalan
  18 kullanıcının kendi açtıklarına. Kendi okumasını reddettiren bir ön yükleme,
  düzeltmeye çalıştığı şeyi bozar.
- **Bütçenin günü UTC olmak zorunda.** Sunucunun penceresi epoch hizalı UTC;
  cihazın yerel günü kullanılsaydı +03:00'ta gece yarısı istemci bütçesi
  sunucudan üç saat önce sıfırlanır ve o üç saatteki istekler 429 yerdi.
- **`ContentNotice` her sebebe "bağlantını kontrol et" diyordu.** Yapılandırması
  olmadan çıkmış bir sürüm derlemesinde bu, kullanıcıyı düzeltemeyeceği bir yere
  yollamak ve gerçek sebebi gizlemek — üstelik `env.problem` hangi değişkenin
  eksik olduğunu adıyla taşıyor ve ekrana hiç ulaşmıyordu. Daha kötüsü: README
  aylardır *"ekranda hangi değişkenin eksik olduğunu söyler"* diye yazıyordu.
  **Davranışı anlatan bir belge, davranış değildir** — bu defterde aynı madde
  bir yorum için zaten var, bu sefer README'de oldu. `unconfigured` artık kendi
  hata kodu ve şerit sebebi yazıyor; yeniden deneme düğmesi de çizilmiyor,
  çünkü aynı paket her denemede aynı cevabı verir.
- **Bir ekranın bir hook'u çağırdığını hiçbir birim testi göremez.** Isıtma
  hook'unun kendi testleri, `FeedView`'daki çağrı silinse yeşil kalır — ve
  silindiğinde görünen tek şey haberlerin yine yavaş açılması olur, ki bunu
  kimse hata diye bildirmez. `check:release` çağrının yerinde durduğunu
  doğruluyor; üç kırılmanın üçünde de kırmızı verdiği görüldü.
- **`gcTime: 0` bir önbellek testini kendi kurulumuyla kırar.** Gözlemcisi
  olmayan bir `setQueryData` girdisi anında toplanıyor, yani "önbelleğe yazdı
  mı" iddiası her zaman `undefined` görüyor. Sızıntı korkusuyla sıfırlamak
  yerine sonlu bir değer verip `afterEach`'te `client.clear()` demek gerekiyor.

### "Yayına girmeden hazırlansın" — sunucu değiştirilemiyorken

- **Backend deposu emekliye ayrıldı, dağıtılmış fonksiyonlar çalışmaya devam
  ediyor.** Doğru düzeltme (`sync-feeds` yeni haberi eklerken özet işini de
  kuyruğa koysun) oraya yazılamıyor. Uygulamanın elindeki tek kaldıraç **ne
  göstereceği**, o yüzden "yayın" burada akışa girmek olarak tanımlandı: özeti
  olmayan taze haber listeye hiç girmiyor, arka planda ısıtılıyor, hazır olunca
  geliyor. Kaldıracın olmadığı yerde tanımı değiştirmek, sorunu görmezden
  gelmekten iyidir — ama bunun bir tanım değişikliği olduğu yazılmalı.
- **İçerik saklayan her kuralın bir tavanı olmak zorunda.** Gövdesi olmayan bir
  haberin özeti hiç üretilemiyor (`unavailable`), yani `summary_ready` sonsuza
  kadar false. Tavansız bir kapı o haberi ebediyen saklardı — ve bunu kimse
  bildirmez, çünkü **görünmeyen bir haberin eksik olduğu belli olmaz.** Kapı bu
  yüzden yaşa bağlı: 30 dakika (çekim 15 dakikada bir + worker 2 dakikada bir =
  en kötü ~17 dakika; tavan onun iki katına yakın).
- **Bozuk bir tarihte içerik saklanmıyor.** `publishedAt` okunamıyorsa haber
  gösteriliyor: iki hatadan biri geç gelen bir özet, öteki hiç görünmeyen bir
  haber.
- **Bekleyen haber ekranda söyleniyor.** Sessizce saklamak, kullanıcının
  yenileyip "değişmedi" görmesi demek — ve akış boşken "Bu filtrede haber yok"
  yazmak düpedüz yanlış olurdu; o durumda "HAZIRLANIYOR" yazıyor.
- **Kapı ile ısıtma bir çift, ve tek başlarına ikisi de zararlı.** Kapısız
  ısıtma yarım hazırlanmış haberi akışa sokar; ısıtmasız kapı haberleri pencere
  dolana kadar saklar. `check:release` ikisinin de yerinde durduğunu ayrı ayrı
  doğruluyor.
- **`EXPO_PUBLIC_*` bir EAS değişkeninde `secret` olamaz, `plain text`
  olmalı.** Değer zaten derleme anında JS paketine gömülüyor; `.ipa`'yı açan
  herkes okuyabiliyor. `secret` görünürlük hiçbir şey saklamıyor — yalnızca
  `eas env:list` ile geri okumayı engelleyip doğrulamayı imkânsız yapıyor.
  Supabase anon anahtarı da tasarımı gereği açık; koruma RLS'te.
- **`eas env:create` `.env` okumuyor.** Değeri yalnızca `--value`'dan alıyor,
  hangi klasörde çalıştırıldığının değere etkisi yok. Dosyadan yükleyen komut
  ayrı: `eas env:push <ortam> --path .env`. (`env:create` artık deprecated,
  yerine `eas env:set`.)

### Bildirim otomasyonu — kime, neye göre, ve neyin gitmemesi gerektiği

- **`devices` yazılmıyorsa push diye bir şey yok.** Token bir `useRef`'te
  duruyordu ve onu okuyan efektin bağımlılığı değildi: `hydrated` true olunca
  efekt koşuyor, token o an `null`, ve token gelince ref yazılıyor ama render
  tetiklenmediği için efekt bir daha koşmuyor. Sonuç, cihaz kaydının yalnızca
  kullanıcı bir ayarı değiştirdiğinde yazılması. Bir promise'in çözümünü ref'e
  yazıp o ref'i bir efektin okumasını beklemek, React'te her zaman bu hata.
- **Otomasyonda asıl iş "ne gönderilmeyecek".** Gelmeyen bildirim can sıkar;
  gelmemesi gereken bildirim güveni bozar ve geri alınamaz. `src/pushPolicy.ts`
  bu yüzden saf ve her dalı testli: düzenlemede gönderme (bir yazım hatası
  düzeltmesi herkese ikinci "yeni atölye" atmasın), geçmiş tarihli etkinliği
  duyurma, **hiç duyurulmamış etkinliğin iptalini duyurma** (kullanıcının hiç
  duymadığı bir şeyin iptal edildiğini söylemek), boş kazanan listesini
  duyurma (o "sonucu geri al" demek).
- **Önce kilit, sonra gönderim.** `pushLog/{kind}__{eventId}` dokümanı
  `create()` ile yazılıyor — var olan kimlikte fırlıyor, yani iki eşzamanlı
  istek de aynı bildirimi gönderemiyor. Sıra ters olsaydı yarıda kalan bir
  istek yeniden denendiğinde herkese ikinci kez giderdi.
- **Sessiz saatler atlama değil erteleme.** Eski `send-push` sessiz saatlerdeki
  cihazı listeden düşürüyordu: gece açılan bir atölyeyi o kullanıcılar hiç
  duymuyordu ve düzeltmesi "sabah komutu tekrar çalıştır"dı — yani otomasyonun
  olmadığı yer. Şimdi `pendingPushes`'a giriyor ve panel 08:00'de gönderiyor.
- **Kuyruktan çıkan bildirim yeniden doğrulanıyor.** Aradan gece geçiyor:
  etkinlik silinmiş olabilir (o zaman bildirim düşürülüyor — sabah "yeni
  atölye" deyip kullanıcıyı silinmiş bir kayda göndermek en kötüsü) ve
  kullanıcı gece bildirimleri kapatmış olabilir.
- **Sessiz saat penceresi kulüp saatinde hesaplanıyor.** Panel bir konteynerde
  koşuyor ve dilimi genellikle UTC; `new Date().getHours()` ile hesaplanan
  pencere üç saat kaymış olurdu — 23:00 UTC, Kocaeli'de 02:00. `clubHour`
  `todayLocal` ve `clubCalendar`'ın yanında duruyor.
- **Otomatik gönderim varsayılan olarak AÇIK, ve panel açılışta hangi modda
  olduğunu yazıyor.** Kapalı varsayılan, bu defterdeki iki maddenin aynısı
  olurdu: sessizce çalışmayan bir özellik. Yerelde çalışırken gerçek
  kullanıcılara gitmesini engellemek için `ADMIN_AUTO_PUSH=off`.
- **Bir yerel zamanlayıcı içeriği bilemez.** Bülten bildirimi "Bugünün beş
  başlığı hazır." diyordu; kurulduğu an ile çaldığı an arasında bir gün var ve
  o gün bülten üretilmemiş olabilir. İçeriğe göre konuşan bildirim ancak
  sunucudan gelen bir push olabilir — zamanlayıcıyla söylenebilecek doğru şey
  bir hatırlatma.
- **Ayar ekranındaki açıklama bir vaattir.** "Kontenjan güncellendiğinde" ve
  "başvuru dönemleri" yazıyordu; ikisini de tetikleyen hiçbir şey yoktu.
  Açıklamalar artık kodun yaptığını anlatıyor, ve yeni bir kategori
  açıklamasının karşılığı yoksa önce mekanizma yazılmalı.
- **Duyuru otomasyonunun ilk turu sessiz olmak zorunda.** Duyurular panelde
  değil kulübün sitesinde yazılıyor, yani panel onları yoklayarak öğreniyor.
  Defter boşken sitedeki her duyuru "yeni" görünür: otomasyon devreye girdiği
  gün herkesin telefonu arka arkaya on kez titrerdi. İlk tur yalnızca mevcut
  listeyi işaretliyor (`pushState/announcements.seededAt`), bildirim bir
  sonraki gerçekten yeni duyuruyla başlıyor. Yaş sınırı (24 saat) ikinci
  koruma: panel bir süre kapalı kalıp geri döndüğünde birikmiş listeyi görüyor.
- **Okunamayan tarihte hangi tarafa düşüleceği içeriğe göre değişir.** Akış
  kapısında bozuk `publishedAt` haberi **gösteriyor** (içerik saklamamak için);
  duyuru bildiriminde bozuk `createdAt` **göndermiyor**. Risk ters yönde: orada
  saklanan bir haber, burada herkese giden bir bildirim.
- **Bir guard'ın aradığı dize yalnızca korumak istediği yerde geçmeli.** Duyuru
  dokunma dalını doğrulayan kontrol `announcementId` arıyordu; o ad tip
  anotasyonunda da geçiyor, dolayısıyla dal silindiğinde kontrol yeşil kaldı —
  ölçüldü. Artık rotayı (`/duyuru/`) arıyor. Alan adı değil, davranışın izi.
- **Kilit gönderimden önce alınıyorsa, başarısız gönderimde geri verilmeli.**
  Yinelenen bildirim eksik bildirimden çok daha fazla zarar verdiği için sıra
  doğru; ama gönderim patladığında `catch` hatayı yutuyor ve kilit kalıyordu —
  o olay bir daha asla duyurulamaz, ve kimse fark etmez. Kimseye ulaşmamış bir
  gönderimin kilidi siliniyor: gönderilmemiş bir şeyin ikinci denemesi
  yinelenen bildirim üretemez. Yan etkisi de doğru yöne bakıyor —
  `alreadyAnnounced` artık "denendi mi" değil "duyuruldu mu" diyor, ki iptal
  bildiriminin dayandığı şey tam olarak bu.
- **Zincirin her halkası sessizce koptuğunda teşhis bir özelliktir.** Cihaz
  kaydı yazılmamış olabilir, panel eski kodu çalıştırıyor olabilir, gönderim
  kimseye ulaşmamış olabilir — üçünün de tek belirtisi "bildirim gelmedi"ydi ve
  üçü de sunucu günlüğünde yazıyordu, ki operatör ona bakmıyor. Panelin
  `/bildirimler` sayfası bunu ekrana taşıyor. Aynı soruyu üç kez yaşadıktan
  sonra eklendi.
- **`tsx` üst düzey `await`'i CJS'e çeviremiyor** (`ERR_REQUIRE_ASYNC_MODULE`).
  `check:panel`'e asenkron bir kontrol eklerken IIFE gerekiyor — ve çıkış
  satırları da o bloğun içine taşınmalı, yoksa iddialar sayılmadan
  `process.exit` koşar ve kontrol her zaman yeşil verir.
- **`autoIncrement: true` sürümü değil build numarasını artırıyor.** Kurulu
  `@expo/eas-json` şeması net: profil kökünde alan yalnızca `boolean`, ama
  `ios` altında `'version' | 'buildNumber'`, `android` altında
  `'version' | 'versionCode'` da kabul ediliyor. Yani `production`'daki
  `autoIncrement: true` her derlemede `buildNumber`/`versionCode` artırıyor ve
  kullanıcıya görünen `version` **hiç değişmiyor** — mağazada yayımlanmış bir
  sürümün üzerine yeni sürüm çıkarırken `app.json` elle güncellenmek zorunda.
  "Otomatik artıyor" diye bırakmak, App Store'un aynı sürüm numarasını ikinci
  kez kabul etmemesiyle sonuçlanıyor.
- **Sürüm otomatiğe bağlanmadı, ve bu bir karar.** `ios.autoIncrement:
  "version"` mümkün ama aynı sürümün beş TestFlight derlemesi 1.1.5 üretirdi;
  üstelik `appVersionSource: "remote"` ile sayı EAS'a taşındığı için depoya
  bakan biri hangi sürümün canlıda olduğunu göremezdi. Sürüm bir ürün kararı,
  sayaç değil.

### "Çeviri geç geliyor / hiç gelmiyor" raporundan

**Bu bölüm bir kez yanlış yazıldı ve canlı veri düzeltti.** Önce yalnızca kaynak
kodu okunarak "sebep rate limit değil, sunucunun dört tavanı" denmişti. Sonra
Supabase MCP bağlanınca ölçüldü ve tablo bunun tersini söyledi. Kaynak okumak
mekanizmayı verir, **hangi mekanizmanın gerçekten tetiklendiğini vermez** —
onun için üretim verisi gerekiyor. Aşağıdakiler ölçülmüş hâli.

Ölçüm anı: 22 ölü iş, `private.ai_jobs where status='failed'`:

| `last_error_code` | adet | ort. gövde |
|---|---|---|
| `rate_limited` | **13** | 1257 karakter |
| `output_truncated` | 6 | **139 karakter** |
| `server_error` | 1 | 164 |
| `schema_summary_wrong_length` | 1 | 141 |
| `schema_summary_item_too_long` | 1 | 166 |

- **Kullanıcının hipotezi doğruydu: hız limiti birinci sebep.** 22 ölümün 13'ü
  `rate_limited`, hepsi 5 denemeyi tüketmiş. "Sebep rate limit değil" demek
  yanlıştı.
- **İkinci anahtar kurulu ve çalışıyor.** Log satırı bunu yazıyor:
  `"provider":"gemini","fallback":"nvidia"`. Vault'ta iki anahtar da var. Yani
  429'da NVIDIA deneniyor — ve yine de 13 iş öldüyse ya ikisi birden dolmuştu ya
  da NVIDIA de reddetti. `withFallback` her iki taraf da düşünce **primary'nin**
  kodunu yazıyor, o yüzden satırdaki `rate_limited` "yalnızca Gemini doldu"
  demek değil.
- **Ama failover'ın kapsamadığı bir sınıf var:** `refusal`, `auth`,
  `bad_request` ve **her `schema_*`** non-retryable, ikinci sağlayıcıya hiç
  gitmiyor (`_shared/ai-provider.ts` `withFallback`).
- **`output_truncated` uzun makalede değil, EN KISA makalelerde çıkıyor.** Bu,
  ilk okumada tam ters tahmin edilmişti. Altı işin ortalama gövdesi 139, en
  büyüğü 191 karakter — ve bir kısmı düz metin bile değil, görsel alt-yazısı
  (*"Collage of images created by Google Pics, with the text…"*). 89 karakterlik
  bir alt-yazıdan üç ayrı özet maddesi + tam çeviri istemek imkânsıza yakın;
  model çıktı bütçesini bu işe harcayıp `finishReason: MAX_TOKENS` ile dönüyor.
  İki `schema_*` hatası da aynı sınıf (141 ve 166 karakter).
- **Gözlemlenmedi: `AI_DAILY_CAP` ve iş hızı tavanı hiç devreye girmemiş.**
  Kod bunları taşıyor (`max_jobs: 3` × iki dakikada bir = saatte 90;
  `AI_DAILY_CAP_DEFAULT = 200`) ama ölçüm anında kuyrukta **sıfır** bekleyen iş
  vardı ve toplam `ready` 139'du — yani tavanlara yaklaşılmamış bile. Koddaki
  bir sınırı "darboğaz" ilan etmeden önce ona değilip değinilmediğine bakın.
- **Çeviri ve özet tek çağrı, tek şema — biri giderse ikisi de gidiyor.**
  `_shared/schemas.ts`: makale dili `tr` değilse model çeviriyi vermek
  **zorunda**, vermezse `translation_missing_for_foreign_article`. Dil de
  tespit edilmiyor, kaynaktan miras alınıyor (`_shared/ingest.ts`).
- **Ölü bir iş istemciye hâlâ `queued` görünüyor.** `_shared/enrichment.ts`:
  denemeleri tükenmiş işin cevabı yine `queued`, sebep `previous_attempt_failed`.
  Yani "hazırlanıyor" ile "bir daha asla" kablodan aynı `status` ile geçiyor;
  ayıran tek şey `reason`.
- **Haberlerin kısa olması hata değil, besleme.** `_shared/feed.ts`: tam metin
  çekimi yok. `content:encoded` varsa tam gövde, yoksa `<description>` yani
  teaser — ve kodun kendi yorumu "altı beslemeden yalnızca Webrazzi
  `content:encoded` gönderiyor" diyor. Haberin taze olması uzunluğunu
  değiştirmiyor; uzunluğu yayıncı belirliyor.

Uygulamanın kaldıracı yine yalnızca **ne göstereceği**: teşhis zaten
`console.warn`'a yazılıyordu ve bir release derlemesinin konsolu yok, yani
kullanıcıya ulaşan tek şey sonsuza kadar dönen bir göstergeydi. Artık sunucu
bir `reason` bildirdiğinde (`previous_attempt_failed`, `no_api_key`) gösterge
durup sebep yazılıyor (`enrichmentStalledMessage`); sebepsiz `queued` — yani iş
gerçekten sırasını bekliyorken — "hazırlanıyor" doğru olduğu için değişmedi.

**Ölü işler SQL ile geri kuyruğa alınabiliyor** ve bu, kullanıcının kaybettiği
özetleri geri getiren tek hamle: `update private.ai_jobs set status='queued',
attempt_count=0, available_at=now(), lease_token=null, leased_until=null where
status='failed'`. `last_error_code` bilerek korunuyor — kesilme kaçışı
(`enrichment.ts`) bir önceki hatanın `output_truncated` olmasına bakıyor.
Ölçüldü: 22 ölü işten 12'si ilk 15 dakikada `ready` oldu, biri (184 karakterlik
görsel alt-yazısı) yeniden öldü — ki doğrusu o.

### React Query'nin izlenen özellikleri — iki ölçüm

İkisi de yukarıdaki düzeltmeyi yazarken çıktı ve ikisi de sessizce yanlış
davranıyordu.

- **`dataUpdateCount` `QueryState`'te duruyor, `useQuery`'nin döndürdüğü nesnede
  değil** (kurulu `@tanstack/query-core` tiplerinde ölçüldü: `QueryState`'te var,
  `QueryObserverBaseResult`'ta yok). Client'tan okunabiliyor ama **izlenen bir
  özellik olmadığı için değiştiğinde render tetiklemiyor** — ondan türetilen bir
  bayrak hiçbir zaman dönmüyor. Yoklama sayacına dayanan "yoklama bitti mi"
  bayrağı tam olarak böyle çalışmadı.
- **Sonucu yaymak (`{...query}`) her alana abone olmaktır.** İzlenen özellikler
  hangi alanı okursanız ona abone ediyor; yaymak bütün getter'ları okuyor,
  dolayısıyla optimizasyonu kapatıp fazladan render üretiyor. Görünür sonucu:
  yoklama bitiminde bir kez yazılması gereken uyarı iki kez yazıldı ve mevcut
  "warns once" testi kırmızı verdi. `Object.assign(query, …)` hedefi okumadığı
  için aboneliği bozmuyor — ama yukarıdaki madde yüzünden o da çözüm değildi.

Sonuçta sayaç hiç kullanılmadı: "iş öldü" bilgisi zaten sunucudan ilk cevapta
`previous_attempt_failed` olarak geliyor, ve "şu an gerçekten deniyor muyuz"
sorusunun cevabı `isFetching`. **Türetilecek bir durum ararken önce elde olanı
sayın** — sayaç, olmayan bir soruna yazılmış bir mekanizmaydı.

### Panel güvenlik taramasından — Strix çalıştırılamadı, elle okundu

- **Docker soketi ve LLM anahtarı olmayan bir konteynerde Strix çalışmıyor;**
  bulut yolu kaynak kodu üçüncü tarafa yüklüyor ve o karar operatörün. Bu tur
  skill'in kendi listesi (rotalar, sink'ler, yetki kontrolleri, dışa aktarma)
  elle izlendi. Aşağıdaki üç bulgu o okumadan.
- **Aynı yardımcı fonksiyonun üç kopyası, bir düzeltmeyi ikisinde unutmanın
  yoludur.** CSV hücresi `server.ts`'te iki kez, `export-registrations.ts`'te
  bir kez yazılmıştı; üçü de tırnaklıyor, üçü de `=`/`+`/`-`/`@` ile başlayan
  hücreyi olduğu gibi geçiriyordu. Adı öğrenci giriyor ve kural yalnızca
  uzunluğa bakıyor, yani `=HYPERLINK(...)` geçerli bir ad — dosyayı açan
  yöneticinin makinesinde çalışır. Tek `csvCell` (`admin/csv.ts`);
  `check:release` üç yazıcının da ondan geçtiğini doğruluyor.
- **Sabit bir oturum jetonu, süresi olmayan bir oturumdur.** Jeton sabit bir
  metnin imzasıydı: herkese aynı değer, sunucuda eskimeyen tek şey. Çerezin
  `Max-Age`'i tarayıcının verdiği söz, sunucunun değil. Veriliş zamanı artık
  imzanın içinde (`issueToken`/`verifyToken`), sunucu yine hiçbir şey saklamıyor.
- **Zaman-sabiti karşılaştırma deneme sayısını sınırlamaz.** `/login`'in
  önünde hiçbir sayaç yoktu. IP başına 10 hata / 15 dakika, süreç içi
  (`loginLimiter`); `req.ip` `trust proxy 1` sayesinde proxy'nin yazdığı adres.
- **Kurallardaki kalan açık tasarımsal:** istemci kimliksiz, dolayısıyla
  `registrations`'a spam yazılabilir (dokuz haneli numara uzayı) ve bir
  etkinlik sahte kayıtla doldurulabilir. Kural bunu durduramaz; cevabı
  Firebase App Check. Bu tur yapılmadı, bir satırlık iş değil.

### Giriş sistemi — ölçülen iki çözümleme tuzağı

- **`firebase/auth` React Native'de yanlış derlemeye çözülüyordu, ve bu
  sessiz.** `firebase` 12.17.1'in `./auth` ihracat haritasında `react-native`
  koşulu **yok**; Expo SDK 57'de iOS/Android koşul kümesi tam olarak
  `["react-native"]` ve `unstable_enablePackageExports` açık (ölçüldü, tahmin
  değil: `getDefaultConfig()` yazdırıldı). `node` ve `browser` koşulları aktif
  olmadığı için `default` dalına düşülüyor.
  **Ama zincir yine de doğru yere varıyor:** o dal tek satır —
  `export * from '@firebase/auth'` — ve Metro o iç içe isteği kendi
  koşullarıyla çözüp `@firebase/auth/dist/rn/index.js`'i yüklüyor, ki o
  derleme `getReactNativePersistence`i ihraç ediyor. Yani cihazda **çalışıyor**.
  Node/Jest'te çalışmıyor (`node` koşulu kazanıyor) ve TypeScript göremiyor
  (`exports` haritasında `"types"` anahtarı `"react-native"`ten önce geliyor,
  ilk eşleşen kazanıyor, paylaşılan `auth-public.d.ts`'e düşülüyor).
  Üç ortam üç ayrı cevap veriyor; bunu okuyarak değil ölçerek ayırmak gerekti.
  `check:release` zincirin üç halkasını da (koşul, RN derlemesinin ihracatı,
  umbrella'nın yeniden ihracı) ayrı ayrı doğruluyor — biri kopunca oturum
  sessizce belleğe düşer ve sürüm derlemesinde konsol yok.
- **`initializeAuth` çağrılmazsa kalıcılık bellek oluyor.** Belirti bir hata
  değil: "uygulama beni unutuyor". Kimse bunu bir hata olarak bildirmez.
- **Bir kontrolün kendi gerekçesini bulması, bu defterde dördüncü kez oldu.**
  Yasal rotaların `app.use(requireAuth)`'tan önce kayıtlı olduğunu doğrulayan
  guard, rotaların **üstündeki yorumda** geçen `app.use(requireAuth)` metnini
  buluyordu ve sıra doğruyken kırmızı veriyordu. Öncekiler (`addDoc`,
  `increment(1)`, `HOLD_MS`) ters yönde yanılıyordu; bu yanlış alarm verdi, ki
  daha az tehlikeli ama aynı kök. `strip()` olmadan kaynak eşleştirilmiyor —
  artık istisnasız.
- **Play'in web silme şartı, rotanın giriş duvarının önünde olmasını
  gerektiriyor.** Panelde `app.use(requireAuth)`'tan sonra kayıt edilen bir
  `/hesap-sil` sayfası açılıyor görünür ve giriş ekranına yönlendirir; yani
  şart karşılanmamış olur ve kimse fark etmez. Sıra `check:release`'te.
- **Admin SDK parola doğrulayamıyor** — tasarımı gereği, ayrıcalıklı taraf
  parolayı hiç görmüyor. Web silme sayfasının kimlik doğrulaması bu yüzden
  Identity Toolkit'in `signInWithPassword` uç noktasından geçiyor. Doğrulama
  olmasaydı bir e-posta adresini bilen herkes başkasının hesabını sildirebilirdi.
- **`registrations` kuralında `uid` bilerek İSTEĞE BAĞLI.** Mağazada hesapsız
  bir sürüm var; alanı zorunlu kılmak, kural yayınlandığı saniyede o sürümü
  kullanan herkesin kaydını reddeder. Yazılan `uid` yine de yazana ait olmak
  zorunda: kimliksiz kayıt serbest, **başkasının kimliğiyle** kayıt değil.
  Yeni sürüm yayıldıktan sonra zorunluya çevrilecek.

### "Hesabım yok aq" — yazılmış ama bağlanmamış bir ekranın maliyeti

- **Giriş ekranları eklendi, onlara giden kapı eklenmedi.** `/hesap`, `/giris`
  ve `/kayit-ol` çalışır hâldeydi; uygulamada hiçbir şey oraya gitmiyordu.
  Kayıt formundaki kapı dışında sisteme girişin yolu yoktu, yani kullanıcı
  açısından özellik **yoktu**. Bu, bu defterdeki "bir ekranın bir hook'u
  çağırdığını hiçbir birim testi göremez" maddesinin rota hâli: dosyanın var
  olması, ona erişilebildiği anlamına gelmiyor. `check:release` artık hesap
  sekmesinin giriş, kayıt, bildirim ayarları ve hesap silmeye bağlandığını
  doğruluyor.
- **Sekme çubuğu adları elle yazılmış bir liste.** Dosyası olmayan bir ad boş
  bir sekme çiziyor ve dokununca hiçbir şey olmuyor — hata yok, log yok. Bir
  ekranı yeniden adlandırıp listeyi güncellememek bunu sessizce üretiyor.
  Kontrol her sekme adı için `app/(tabs)/<ad>.tsx` var mı diye bakıyor.
- **Bildirim ayarları bir sekme değil, hesap ayarıydı.** Beş sekmeden biri
  olması, uygulamanın günlük kullanımında hiç açılmayan bir ekrana kalıcı yer
  ayırıyordu; asıl eksik olan "benim tarafım" sekmesiydi. Bildirimler artık
  Hesabım → Ayarlar altında, ve üç ekranın başlığındaki zil düğmesi oraya
  kısayol olarak duruyor.
- **Hesap sekmesi giriş istemiyor, ve istememeli.** Guideline 5.1.1(v) hesap
  tabanlı olmayan içeriği giriş duvarının arkasına koymayı yasaklıyor; üstelik
  sekmedeki şeylerin çoğu gerçekten hesaba bağlı değil — kayıtlar cihazda,
  bildirim tercihleri cihaza ait. Oturum yokken sekme bir duvar değil, neyin
  kazanılacağını anlatan bir kart gösteriyor. `check:release` sekmenin
  `/giris`'e yönlendirmediğini ayrıca doğruluyor.
- **Hesap silme kendi ekranına taşındı.** Geri alınamayan bir işlem, ayarların
  dibinde yanlışlıkla dokunulabilecek bir yerde durmamalı. Apple'ın "gereksiz
  yere zorlaştırmayın" kuralı adım sayısını değil engelleri kastediyor; ayrı
  ekran + parola + onay izin verilen doğrulama.
- **Kayıt listesi geçmiş etkinlikleri de okumak zorunda.** `useContent().events`
  yalnızca yaklaşanları veriyor (`splitByDate`), dolayısıyla olmuş bir
  etkinliğin kaydı kartta başlık yerine ham kimliğini gösterirdi. Liste
  `events` + `archive` üzerinden arıyor.

### Doğum tarihi kutusu — biçimlendirmenin girdiyi kilitlemesi

- **Her tuş vuruşunda doldurmak, alanı kullanılamaz hâle getiriyor.**
  `DateFields` birleştirilmiş `YYYY-MM-DD` değerini tek doğru kaynak sayıyordu:
  yıla `2` yazılınca `pad` onu `0002` yapıyor, dört hane kutuya geri basılıyor
  ve `maxLength={4}` dolduğu için klavye beşinci haneyi **kabul etmiyor**.
  Gün ve ayda da aynısı (`2` → `02`, iki hane dolu). Simülatörde ölçüldü:
  `2005` ancak yapıştırılarak girilebildi. Hata bir çökme ya da uyarı değil —
  tuşa basılıyor ve hiçbir şey olmuyor, ki bu en geç fark edilen sınıf.
- **Kural: bir girdi kutusunun değeri, kullanıcının yazdığı ham hâl olmalı.**
  Normalleştirme (doldurma, biçimlendirme, kesme) ancak kutunun **dışına**
  çıkarken uygulanabilir. Ekrana geri yazılan her normalleştirme, kullanıcının
  bir sonraki tuşuyla yarışıyor.
- **Yarım girdi ile tam değer aynı şey değil.** `joinDate` üç kutu da dolmadan
  boş dönüyor; doldurma yalnızca orada ve yalnızca tamamlanmış tarihte oluyor.
  Kutular kendi ham hanelerini `useState` ile tutuyor.
- **Ekranın içine gömülü bir bileşenin testi olmuyor, o yüzden hatası da
  görünmüyordu.** Karar `src/accountSchema.ts`'e (`splitDate`/`joinDate`/
  `digits`) taşındı ve testi yazıldı; eski doldurma davranışı geri konunca iki
  test kırmızı verdi — ölçüldü.
- **React 19'da `ref` sıradan bir prop**, `forwardRef` gerekmiyor; ama paylaşılan
  `Input` bileşeninin tipinde yazılmazsa TS2322 veriyor. Hane dolunca sıradaki
  kutuya odaklanmak bunu kullanıyor.

### Sekiz piksellik bir glif yolu okunarak değerlendirilemez

- **Hesap ikonu istenmeyen bir siluet okuyordu ve bunu kullanıcı bildirdi.**
  Yol olarak yazılınca makul görünüyordu: baş, boyun, omuz, gövde. Izgaraya
  basılınca sorun apaçık — iki piksellik "boyun", altındaki tam genişlikteki
  kütleyle birleşince başka bir şey okutuyor. **Bu deponun defterinde zaten
  bir bildirim ikonu maddesi var** ("24dp'de gri bulamaç olur, tam çözünürlükte
  yargılanamaz"); aynı ders, bu sefer ASCII ızgarada.
- **Kural: iki geniş dolu satır arasında dar bir dolu satır bırakma.** Boyun
  yerine **boş satır** kondu; baş ile omuz birbirine değmiyor. Boş satır kuralı
  bozmuyor çünkü kural yalnızca dolu satırlara bakıyor.
- Kontrol `src/__tests__/icons.test.ts`'te ve eski yol geri konunca iki testi
  birden kırmızı verdi — ölçüldü. Bir glifi değerlendirmenin tek yolu onu
  basmak: testteki `rowWidths` aynı ayrıştırmayı yapıyor.
- **Bir düzeltmenin ürettiği yeni şekil de bir şekil.** Boyun kalkınca alt üç
  satır 8×3'lük dolu bir dikdörtgene indi ve aynı kullanıcı bu sefer "kolu yok,
  özürlü duruyor" diye bildirdi: dolu bir blokta anatomi okunmuyor. Kollar artık
  birer piksel, gövdeden birer piksellik boşlukla ayrı, ve gövdeden **bir satır
  önce bitiyor** — bitmeselerdi üç paralel çubuk olurlardı, kol değil.
- **Satır genişliği anatomiyi göremiyor.** Mevcut iki iddia (boğum yok, baş ile
  gövde arasında boş satır) kolsuz dikdörtgende de yeşildi — ölçüldü: eski yol
  geri konduğunda ikisi de geçti, yalnızca yeni iddia kırmızı verdi. `rowRuns`
  satırdaki **ayrı parça** sayısını sayıyor: `████████` bir, `█ . ████ . █` üç.
  Bir şekli koruyacak iddia, o şeklin bozulduğunda değişen şeyi ölçmeli;
  genişlik burada o şey değildi.

### Doğrulama postası, teklik ve OTP

- **Firebase Auth'un doğrulama postasının spam'e düşmesi şablon sorunu
  değil, alan adı sorunu.** Gönderen `noreply@<proje>.firebaseapp.com` ve o
  alan adı kulübün değil, dolayısıyla `kouseng.com` için yayımlanan SPF/DKIM
  ile hizalanmıyor. Şablonu güzelleştirmek bunu düzeltmiyor; gönderenin
  değişmesi gerekiyor.
  **DOĞRULANMADI:** "Console → Authentication → Templates → SMTP settings ile
  Firebase'in kendi postası da kulübün sunucusundan gönderilebiliyor" diye iki
  kez yazdım; Firebase'in özel e-posta işleyici belgesi yalnızca *action
  handler* özelleştirmesinden bahsediyor, SMTP'den değil ve konsol buradan
  görülemiyor. Parola sıfırlama hâlâ Firebase'den gidiyor; o postayı da kendi
  alan adımızdan göndermenin kesin yolu, kodu OTP hattına taşımak.
- **`emailVerified` yalnızca Firebase'in kendi bağlantısıyla ya da Admin SDK
  ile değişiyor.** Kendi kodumuzla doğrulamanın tek yolu sunucuda
  `updateUser(uid, {emailVerified:true})`. Ve istemcinin jetonu bayat kalıyor:
  `reload()` + `getIdToken(true)` çağrılmazsa uygulama doğrulanmış hesabı
  doğrulanmamış görmeye devam ediyor — belirti "doğruladım ama hâlâ
  katılamıyorum".
- **Doküman kimliği `uid` olmayan koleksiyon, silme yoklayıcısının listesine
  giremiyor.** `phoneClaims/{telefon}` ve `studentClaims/{ogrenciNo}`
  kimliklerini değerin kendisinden alıyor, yani ne `USER_DOC_COLLECTIONS`'a ne
  de `uid` ile sorgulanan listeye uyuyorlar. Atlansaydı hesap silinmiş
  görünür, ama aynı kişi bir daha kayıt olamazdı: numarası sonsuza kadar
  kilitli kalırdı ve bunu kimse bir hata olarak bildirmezdi. Serbest bırakma
  profil **okunduktan sonra, silinmeden önce** olmak zorunda — hangi değerler
  olduğu yalnızca orada yazıyor.
- **Tek bir hız sınırı iki işi görmüyor.** 60 saniyelik yeniden gönderim
  beklemesi düğmeye üst üste basmayı engelliyor ama saatte 60 posta demek;
  saatlik tavan olmadan biri başkasının kutusunu doldurabilir. İki sınır ayrı
  sebeplerle var ve ikisi de gerekiyor.
- **Doğrulamada sıra: önce kilit ve süre, sonra yanlış kod.** Tersi olsaydı
  süresi dolmuş kodu giren kullanıcı "kod yanlış" görür ve doğru kodu aramaya
  başlardı — oysa yapması gereken yeni kod istemek. Kontrol `check:panel`'de
  ve sıra değiştirilince kırmızı verdiği ölçüldü.
- **Çakışma kodu tüketmemeli, ve düzeltme aynı ekranda olmalı.** Telefon ya da
  numara başkasındaysa kullanıcı onu değiştirmek zorunda, ama profili
  düzenleyen bir ekran yok. Olmayan bir ekrana yönlendirmek hesabı kalıcı
  olarak doğrulanamaz bırakırdı; doğrulama ekranı çakışan alanı kendisi açıyor
  ve kod hâlâ geçerli olduğu için tek posta yetiyor.
- **React 19 efektleri geliştirme kipinde iki kez çalıştırıyor**, ve "ekran
  açılınca kod iste" bunu doğrudan hissediyor: ikinci çağrı sunucudan "60
  saniye bekle" yiyor ve kullanıcıya hata gibi görünüyor. `useRef` ile bir kez.
- **İşlem (transaction) burada süs değil.** İki sahiplenme ayrı ayrı
  yazılsaydı telefon tutup numara çakıştığında geride kimsenin sahiplenmediği
  bir kayıt kalırdı. `check:panel` bunu ayrıca sınıyor: çakışan istek hiçbir
  şey yazmamalı.
- **Bir kural, ancak zorlayabildiği şeyi iddia edebilir.** Öğrenci numarasının
  tekliği zorlanıyor; numaranın gerçekten o kişiye ait olduğu **zorlanmıyor**,
  çünkü soracak bir kaynak yok. Ad ise hiç denetlenmiyor — "iki parça, 5–80
  karakter" bir biçim kuralı ve `asdf qwer` her denetimden geçer. Uydurma bir
  denetim yazmak olmayan bir güvenceyi varmış gibi göstermek olurdu; yerine
  geçen şey maliyet, denetim değil: numara tek olduğu için troll ad kendi
  numarasının üstünde kalıyor.
- **İşlemsel postanın spam puanı gövdeden de geliyor.** Düz metin karşılığı
  olmayan posta puan alıyor; yalnızca görselden oluşan gövde de öyle, üstelik
  çoğu istemci görseli engellediği için posta boş bir çerçeve olarak açılıyor.
  Kod postasında bağlantı da yok: hem bağlantı itibarına takılmıyor hem de
  kullanıcıya "bu tür postalardaki bağlantılara basma" demeyi mümkün kılıyor.
  Web fontu (Press Start 2P dâhil) postada çalışmıyor, palet metinle taşınıyor.
- **Bir takma addan gönderemezsiniz — `smtp.gmail.com` From'u kimlik
  doğrulanan hesaba çeviriyor.** Google'ın kendi belgesi düz yazıyor: standart
  Gmail SMTP'de "From adresi kimlik doğrulanan hesapla aynı olmalı", röle
  (`smtp-relay.gmail.com`) ise alan adındaki herhangi bir adrese izin veriyor.
  Yani `SMTP_USER=info@`, `MAIL_FROM=noreply@` yazmak tek başına yetmiyor;
  takma ad `info@` hesabında "farklı adresten gönder" olarak tanımlı değilse
  posta `info@`'dan gidiyor. **Hiçbir yerel kontrol bunu göremez** — gönderilen
  başlık doğru, değiştiren taraf Google. Tek kanıt gelen postanın gönderen
  satırı, o yüzden panele test postası düğmesi kondu (`/bildirimler`).
- **Boş bir `MAIL_FROM` sessizce giriş hesabına düşüyor.** Belgelenmiş ve
  istenen davranış, ama görünmez olursa bütün postalar yanlış adresten gider ve
  kimse fark etmez. Panel hem açılışta hem `/bildirimler` sayfasında hangi
  adresten göndereceğini yazıyor; `check:panel` de `MAIL_FROM`'un `SMTP_USER`'ı
  ezdiğini doğruluyor (ezmeyen hâli kırmızı verdi).
- **Kod gönderme uç noktası gövdeden e-posta almıyor, kimlik jetonundan
  alıyor.** `POST /sendOtp {email}` biçimindeki bir tasarım, kulübün alan
  adından herkese posta gönderilebilen bir kapı olurdu — hız sınırı da
  kurbanın adresine değil isteği atana bağlanamazdı. `verifyIdToken`'dan gelen
  `uid` + `email` ile hem kurban seçilemiyor hem de sayaç doğru yere yazılıyor.
- **Ortam raporu "panel" derken `scripts/`'i saymamalı.** `env:check` ilk
  hâlinde `admin/` ile `scripts/`'i birlikte tarıyordu, ve `check-bundle` ile
  `check-release` `EXPO_PUBLIC_AIGUNDEM_*` adlarını **pakette aramak için**
  geçiriyor. Sonuç: rapor Coolify'a AI Gündem anahtarları girilmesi
  gerekiyormuş gibi görünüyordu ve operatör "niye her şeyi iki kez giriyorum"
  diye sordu — haklıydı, çünkü rapor yanlış söylüyordu. Gerçekte iki yere
  birden girilen **tek** değer var (`EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`) ve rapor
  artık onu adıyla işaretliyor. Bir aracın adı bir şeyi kapsıyor diye onu
  taramaya katmayın; neyin dağıtıldığına bakın.
- **200 tek başına başarı değil, ve `fetch` yönlendirmeyi sessizce takip
  ediyor.** Uç noktayı tanımayan panel isteği `app.use(requireAuth)`'a düşürüp
  `/login`'e yönlendiriyor; `fetch` oraya gidiyor ve elimize **200 + HTML**
  geliyor. Gövdeye bakmayan istemci bunu "kod gönderildi" saydı: ekranda
  "Kodu e-postana gönderdik" yazarken hiçbir posta gönderilmemişti, ve
  `curl -i` olmadan bu ayırt edilemiyordu (cevap `302 … location: /login`).
  Bu, defterdeki "tanınmayan gövdeyi veri saymayın" maddesinin ters yönü:
  orada tanınmayan gövde veriyi ÇÖPE atıyordu, burada YOK olanı VAR sayıyor.
  `cagir()` artık gövdenin JSON olduğunu ve `durum` taşıdığını şart koşuyor;
  `src/__tests__/otp.test.ts` 200+HTML ve tanınmayan JSON için ayrı ayrı
  kırmızı veriyor (eski hâl geri konup ölçüldü).
- **Yalnızca hatayı yazan bir log, "hiç çalışmadı" gibi okunuyor.**
  `/api/hesap/kod` başarılı gönderimde hiçbir şey yazmıyordu; kullanıcı "kod
  gelmedi" dediğinde operatör loga bakıp **boş** buluyor ve bunu "istek
  sunucuya hiç ulaşmadı" diye yorumluyor — oysa posta gönderilmiş de olabilir.
  İki durumu ayıran tek şey başarı satırıydı ve o satır yoktu. Artık alıcı,
  `accepted`, `rejected` ve zarf göndereni yazılıyor (kod YAZILMIYOR).
- **`sendMail` alıcı reddedildiğinde fırlatmıyor.** SMTP sunucusu bağlantıyı
  kabul edip tek tek alıcıları reddedebiliyor; nodemailer bunu `rejected`
  dizisinde döndürüyor, istisna olarak değil. `accepted` boşken istemciye
  "gönderildi" demek, kullanıcıyı hiç gelmeyecek bir postayı beklemeye
  mahkûm ediyordu.
- **Cloud Function bu projede bir seçenek değil.** Dışarıdan gelen her tasarım
  önerisi OTP'yi bir Cloud Function'a koyuyor; deponun iki ayrı maddesi zaten
  yazıyor: dağıtmak Blaze istiyor, proje Spark'ta. Panel (Express + Admin SDK)
  o kutunun yerinde duruyor ve aynı işi yapıyor.

### QR yoklama — kurulurken çıkanlar

- **Jetonu istemciye hiç göstermeden doğrulamanın yolu kuralın `get()`'i.**
  `eventQr/{eventId}` istemciye tamamen kapalı, ama kural değerlendirmesindeki
  `get()` istemcinin okuma izninden geçmiyor — yani kural jetonu okuyup yazılan
  yoklamayla karşılaştırabiliyor, jeton hiçbir zaman kabloya çıkmadan. Sunucu
  uç noktası, Cloud Function ve Blaze gerektirmemesinin tek sebebi bu.
  **Bu depodan doğrulanamıyor** (kural koşturacak ortam yok); ilk gerçek
  etkinlikten önce sahte bir etkinlikle prova şart.
- **Elle işaretlenen yoklama, sonradan okutmayı REDDETTİRİYORDU.** Panel
  `attendance` dokümanını `token` alanı olmadan doğuruyor; aynı öğrenci sonra
  QR okutunca yazma bir *update* oluyor ve güncelleme dalı yalnızca
  `checkedInAt` değişimine izin verdiği için kural reddediyor. Belirti
  kullanıcıda "pencere kapalı" gibi görünüyordu — oysa zaten kayıtlıydı.
  İstemci artık yazmadan önce kendi satırını okuyor.
- **Kamera saniyede onlarca kare veriyor ve her biri `onBarcodeScanned`
  tetikliyor.** Kilit olmadan tek bir okutma onlarca Firestore yazması demek.
  `useRef` ile meşgul bayrağı; `useState` olmazdı, çünkü render beklemeden
  ikinci kare geliyor.
- **`.claude/worktrees/` jest'e giriyordu.** Ajan iş akışları izole çalışmak
  için orada geçici worktree açıyor ve her biri deponun tam kopyası, yani
  `testMatch` aynı testleri ikinci kez — üstelik o worktree'nin yarım kurulmuş
  `node_modules`'üyle — koşturuyor. Sonuç: kendi kodunuz yeşilken `npm test`
  kırmızı ve hata sizin dosyalarınızı gösteriyor. `testPathIgnorePatterns` +
  `modulePathIgnorePatterns`.
- **Guard'ın aradığı dize yalnızca koruduğu yerde geçmeli — BEŞİNCİ kez.**
  `attendance` kuralında jeton karşılaştırmasını doğrulayan kontrol
  `qrTanimi(` arıyordu; o ad pencere satırlarında da geçiyor, dolayısıyla
  jeton karşılaştırması tamamen silindiğinde kontrol yeşil kaldı — ölçüldü.
  Artık `data.token == qrTanimi(...).token` arıyor. Ad değil, davranışın izi.
- **Pencere +03:00'da hesaplanıyor ve kapanış etkinliğin bitişi değil, günün
  sonu.** Salonun interneti en yoğun anda en kötü; pencere bitişte kapansaydı
  akşam bağlantıya kavuşan telefonun yeniden denemesi kalıcı olarak
  reddedilirdi. Yurt dışındaki telefon da günü kaydırmasın diye karşılaştırma
  `todayLocal` ile aynı kaydırmayı kullanıyor.
- **Yoklama "bu kişi salondaydı" demiyor, "bu hesap pencere açıkken jetonu
  gönderdi" diyor.** Kodun paylaşılması bilinçli olarak engellenmiyor ve
  sertifikanın üstüne bundan fazlası yazılamaz.

### Parola sıfırlama, sertifika ve sunucuda PDF

- **Bir cevabın kendisi bir oracle olabiliyor — gövdesi aynı olsa bile.**
  Kimliksiz sıfırlama uç noktası her durumda birebir aynı JSON'u döndürüyor,
  ama `getUserByEmail` + SMTP el sıkışması "hiçbir şey yapma"dan yüzlerce ms
  uzun; zamanlama tek başına "bu adres kayıtlı mı" sorusunu cevaplıyor. Posta
  bu yüzden **cevap döndükten sonra** gönderiliyor ve bu, `/api/hesap/kod`'un
  kuralını (gönderim patlarsa kaydı sil, 502 dön) bilerek ihlal ediyor: orada
  çağıran kimliği bilinen kişi, burada gönderim sonucunu söylemek adresin
  kayıtlı olduğunu söylemek demek.
- **Ekranın adım geçişi sunucu cevabına bağlanmamalı.** Sunucu tarafı kusursuz
  tekdüze olsa bile, istemci kod ekranını yalnızca "kullanıcı var" cevabında
  açsaydı oracle tam orada olurdu. Kayıtlı olmayan adresi yazan kişi kod
  ekranını görüyor ve her kod "hatalı" diyor — kabul edilen maliyet bu.
- **İki OTP hattı aynı tuzu kullanamaz.** Doğrulama kaydı `emailOtp/{uid}`,
  sıfırlama kaydı `passwordReset/{sha256(eposta)}`; `hashCode`'un tuzu artık
  **kaydın doküman kimliği**, kullanıcı kimliği değil. İkisi de `uid` ile
  tuzlansaydı bir amaç için üretilmiş altı hane öteki amaç için geçerli olurdu:
  doğrulama ekranına yazılan bir sıfırlama kodu e-postayı doğrulardı. Bu bir
  yetki geçişi, ve iki kimlik hiçbir zaman eşit olmadığı için artık yapısal
  olarak imkânsız. Aynı dokümanda dursalardı da biri ötekinin kodunu ezer,
  `attempts`/`sendCount` sayaçlarını paylaşır ve `/api/hesap/dogrula`'nın
  başarıdaki `ref.delete()`'i akıştaki sıfırlamayı sessizce öldürürdü.
- **`revokeRefreshTokens` çağrılıyor ve ne YAPMADIĞI da yazılı:** yenileme
  jetonlarını geçersizleştiriyor, ama elde duran ID jetonları süreleri dolana
  kadar (bir saate kadar) geçerli kalıyor ve **Firestore kuralları iptali
  görmüyor**. Yine de çağrılıyor: parolasını çalındığı için sıfırlayan
  kullanıcının asıl istediği bu, ve çağrılmazsa saldırgan hesapta süresiz
  kalır.
- **Sıfırlama `emailVerified`'a DOKUNMUYOR ve bu bir unutma değil.**
  `accountApi.ts`'in değişmezi "e-posta doğrulanmış ⇒ telefon ve öğrenci
  numarası sahiplenilmiş" (ikisi aynı işlemde oluyor). Sıfırlamada
  `emailVerified: true` yazmak, hiç sahiplenme yapılmamış bir hesabı
  doğrulanmış gösterir ve o değişmezi sessizce kırar.
- **Nixpacks `puppeteer` ALT DİZESİNİ arıyor.** Node sağlayıcısı
  `package.json`/lockfile'da o diziyi görünce (yani `puppeteer-core` de
  tetikliyor) kendi apt listesine `chromium` ekliyor; Ubuntu noble'da gerçek
  bir chromium deb'i yok, `chromium-browser 2:1snap1` snap saplamasına
  çözülüyor ve konteynerde snapd yok. Hiçbir apt satırı yazmamış olursunuz,
  `nixpacks.toml`'a bakınca hiçbir şey görünmez, apt "kurdum" der, derleme
  yeşil geçer. Sertifika PDF'i bu yüzden `playwright-core` ile basılıyor: o
  diziyi taşımıyor ve apt listesi bizim yazdığımız, tamamı görünen liste.
- **Chromium'lu bir panel BOOT'TA ÖLMÜYOR, ve kötü haber bu.** `admin/server.ts`
  tarayıcıya hiç dokunmuyor: süreç açılıyor, sağlık kontrolü geçiyor, Coolify
  yeşil, `/bildirimler` normal. Ölüm **ilk sertifika isteğinde** geliyor —
  etkinlikten haftalar sonra, bir öğrenci beklerken. `Cannot find module
  'express'` iyi bir hatadır: crash-loop, deploy ekranında görünür, sebebi ilk
  satırda yazar. Bunun geciktirilmiş ve tekil versiyonu operatör paneli çalışır
  gördüğü için hiç aranmaz. `pdfDumanTesti()` açılışta bir belge basıp hatayı
  boot'a geri çekiyor; paneli **düşürmüyor** (kayıt, bildirim, OTP ve giriş de
  burada), yalnızca görünür kılıyor.
- **Sistem fontu olmayan bir konteynerde PDF ÜRETİLİYOR ama boş çıkıyor**
  (~1.1 KB), ve base64 `@font-face` gömmek bile kurtarmıyor. Yani
  `fonts-liberation`/`fonts-dejavu-core` süs değil; duman testi de bu yüzden
  bayt sayısına bakıyor, "hata fırlattı mı"ya değil.
- **`setContent` ile yüklenen sayfanın kaynağı `about:blank`, dolayısıyla
  `file://` fontları YÜKLENMİYOR.** Ölçüldü: `document.fonts` dört
  `@font-face`'in dördü için de `error` diyor, data-URI ile dördü de `loaded`.
  Belirti sessiz — PDF yine üretiliyor, bayt sayısı makul, metin çıkarımı
  geçiyor, yalnızca yanlış font. `admin/pdf.ts` fontları bu yüzden gömüyor.
- **Panel kendi fontlarına sahip olmalı.** İlk hâl
  `node_modules/@expo-google-fonts/...` okuyordu; o paket **mobil tarafın**
  bağımlılığı, dolayısıyla biri onu mobilden kaldırdığı gün deploy yeşil geçer
  ve sertifika üretimi ölür — hata da ancak ay sonunda, ilk belge basılırken
  çıkar. Dört dosya `admin/fonts/` altında, 400 KB.
- **Belgenin tek bir tanımı var ve PDF onun basılmış hâli.** `certificateHtml`
  hem herkese açık doğrulama sayfasını hem PDF'i besliyor. pdfkit ya da
  @react-pdf ile PDF'i ayrıca çizmek belgeyi ikinci kez tanımlamak olurdu ve
  ikisinin senkron kalması bir **gelenek** olurdu, iddia değil — bu defterdeki
  "aynı kararı iki yerde uygulamak" maddesi. Bedeli `nixpacks.toml`'a üç yeni
  load-bearing parça; karşılığı ayrışmanın yapısal olarak imkânsız olması.
- **Yayınlama ile teslim ayrı iki adım.** Yayınlama belgeyi var ediyor (numara
  + donmuş ad), teslim ulaştırıyor. Tek adım olsaydı posta patladığında belge
  de yayınlanmamış sayılırdı ve ikinci deneme **yeni bir numara** üretirdi —
  dışarıda paylaşılmış bir adres kırılırdı. Şimdi kayıtta `mailError` duruyor
  ve panel aynı belgeyi yeniden gönderiyor.
- **Belgeye basılan ad yayın anında donuyor.** Profilden canlı okunsaydı kişi
  adını değiştirdiğinde dışarıda paylaşılmış belge sessizce değişirdi — bu onu
  belge olmaktan çıkarır. Operatör yayından ÖNCE düzeltiyor; sonrası iptal +
  yeniden yayın, yani yeni numara.
- **Bir tasarım yanlış görüntü alanında yargılanamaz.** Sertifika 297×210 mm,
  96 dpi'de 1123×794 px. İlk ekran görüntüsü 1587 px genişlikte alındı ve
  belge köşeye sıkışmış, sayfanın dörtte biri boş göründü — "tasarım bitmemiş"
  diye okundu ve bir tur kaybettirdi. Tasarım değil ölçekti.
- **Piksel yıldız mühür boyunda yıldız değil.** Dolu lacivert yuvarlak kare
  sayfanın en ağır öğesiydi ve adla yarışıyordu; içindeki `ICON.star` o ölçekte
  artı işareti gibi okunuyordu. Bu defterde aynı ders iki kez yazılı (bildirim
  ikonu 24dp'de, hesap ikonu 8×8'de) — **üçüncüsü.** Damga artık çizgisel: iki
  halka, tepede küçük bir yıldız aksanı, ortada iki satır kapital.
- **`adSinifi` eşikleri puntoya bağlı ve punto her değiştiğinde YENİDEN
  ölçülmek zorunda.** 46pt'de 21 karakter sığıyordu, 52pt'de sığmıyor; eşikler
  22/34'ten 20/31'e indi ve `check:panel` iddiası kırmızı verdi — yanlış olan
  kod değil beklentiydi, ikinci kez. **İddia sınırın DOĞRU YERDE olduğunu
  söyleyemez, yalnızca kaymadığını.** Doğru yerde olduğunu yalnızca
  `npm run sertifika:onizle` çıktısına bakmak söylüyor, ve iddia sınırın iki
  yanını birden tutuyor: yalnızca "20 tam punto" yazılsaydı eşiği 40'a çekmek
  de yeşil kalırdı.
- **`<p>`nin varsayılan alt payı ölçüyü kaçırıyor.** Sertifikanın orta bloğu
  dikey ortalanmıştı ama altta ~25 mm ölü alan bırakıyordu: pay birleşmesi
  yüzünden `.ortaMetin` göründüğünden kısa ölçülüyor ve ortalama metni yukarı
  itiyordu. Sıfırlanınca düzeldi; basılmadan görünmeyen cinsten.
- **`admin/certificate.ts` şablonunun içinde TERS TIRNAK kullanılamaz** —
  template literal'i kapatıyor ve hata CSS'te değil TypeScript'te,
  "This expression is not callable" diye çıkıyor. **İkinci kez oldu**, ikisi de
  bir CSS yorumunda. Aynı sınıfın başka bir hâli: `scripts/check-release.mjs`
  içindeki bir JSDoc bloğuna `/*` ve `*/` yazmak bloğu erken kapatıyor ve dosya
  `SyntaxError` ile hiç yüklenmiyor — yani **bütün kontroller** düşüyor, ki bu
  yanlış cevaptan daha iyi ama aynı kökten.
### Güvenlik taraması — sekiz sessiz delik ve kapatılmayan ikisi

Sekiz mercek + her bulguya üç bağımsız çürütme denemesi. 56 tekil bulgunun
18'i çürütülemedi; sekiz ayrı kök sebep çıktı ve **hiçbirinin belirtisi
"güvenlik açığı" gibi görünmüyor** — hepsi kullanıcı tarafında başka bir şeye
benziyor.

- **Hesap başına sınır, hesap açmak bedavayken sınır değil.** `/api/hesap/kod`
  `emailOtp/{uid}` dokümanına bakıyordu, yani yeni hesap = sıfır sayaç; Firebase
  kaydı herkese açık ve doğrulanmamış hesap da geçerli bir kimlik jetonu alıyor.
  Elli hesap açan biri kulübün alan adından 250 posta gönderebiliyordu. Sonucu
  veri sızıntısı değil: Workspace'in günlük tavanı dolunca **hiçbir gerçek
  öğrenci kod alamıyor** ve tek belirti "kod gelmiyor". Bir sayaç neyi
  saydığına bakın — **sayılan şeyin maliyeti sıfırsa sayaç bir sınır değil.**
- **`attempts + 1` beş denemelik tavanı paralelleştirerek deldiriyor.**
  Eşzamanlı iki yanlış deneme aynı değeri okuyup aynı sayıyı yazıyor.
  `FieldValue.increment(1)` — ve bu, defterdeki "increment kullanma"
  maddesinin TERSİ durum: orada idempotent bir yeniden gönderim sayıyı
  şişiriyordu, burada her deneme ayrı ayrı sayılmak zorunda. Kural tek cümle:
  **idempotent olması gereken şeyde increment yok, her kez sayılması gereken
  şeyde increment şart.**
- **Kimliksiz `/hesap-sil` aynı anda iki şey sunuyordu:** sınırsız bir parola
  orakülü ve ödülü olarak geri alınamaz silme. Sayaç iki kovada — IP **ve
  denenen e-posta**: yalnızca IP olsaydı botnet tek kurbanı sınırsız denerdi,
  yalnızca e-posta olsaydı bir IP bütün adresleri tarardı. Kilit
  `verifyPassword`'dan önce, yoksa kilitliyken bile her istek bir doğrulama
  çağrısı harcar ve oracle zamanlamada açık kalır.
- **Bir kuralın "bu senin dokümanın mı" diye sorması, "ne yazdın" diye
  sorduğu anlamına gelmiyor.** `users/{uid}` yalnızca sahiplik bakıyordu; panel
  ise `telefon` ve `ogrenciNo`yu oradan okuyup onlara dayanarak
  `phoneClaims`/`studentClaims` kaydı SİLİYOR. Kendi profiline kurbanın
  numarasını yazan biri panele **başkasının teklik kaydını sildirebiliyordu**:
  numara boşa düşüyor, saldırgan onu alıyor, kurban bir daha kendi numarasıyla
  doğrulanamıyor. Belirti kurbanda "numaram başkasında" ve kimse bunu bir
  saldırı olarak bildirmez. İki kapı birden kapandı: panel silmeden önce
  `uid` okuyor, kural da biçimi denetliyor.
  **Genel kural: ayrıcalıklı bir tarafın okuduğu her alan, o alanı yazabilen
  tarafın saldırı yüzeyidir.**
- **`where('uid','==',uid)` `uid` alanı olmayan satırı görmüyor.** Mağazadaki
  hesapsız sürümün yazdığı `registrations` dokümanlarında o alan yok, yani
  hesabını silen kullanıcının adı, numarası ve bölümü veritabanında kalıyordu —
  ekran "bütün verileriniz silinir" derken. Numara ile ikinci bir tur atılıyor.
  Aynı sebeple `raffleEntries` kuralı artık `uid` kabul ediyor ve istemci
  yazıyor; **eski katılımlar için panelde tek seferlik bir temizlik hâlâ
  gerekiyor** (yazılmadı). Silinmiş bir şeyin geride kaldığını kimse
  bildiremez: ancak veritabanına bakan biri görür.
- **`SameSite=Strict` "site" diyor, "origin" demiyor.** Site eTLD+1, yani
  `kouseng.com`: kulübün kendi sitesindeki bir XSS ya da ele geçmiş bir alt
  alan adı, panele **çerezi taşıyan** bir POST yollayabiliyordu. Koruma
  `Origin` başlığı — onu tarayıcı yazıyor ve sayfa JavaScript'i değiştiremiyor,
  yani gizli jetonu her forma eklemeye gerek yok. `/api/` atlanıyor ve bu bir
  boşluk değil: o uç noktalar `Authorization: Bearer` ile çalışıyor, çerez
  taşımıyor — CSRF'in tanımı ambiyans kimlik bilgisi, orada yok.
- **Kimliksiz yazılabilen bir koleksiyonun doküman kimliği biçimsizse,
  koleksiyon sınırsız.** `devices` kimliği push jetonu ve cihaz kaydı girişten
  önce oluyor; biçim denetimi yokken oraya istenen kadar uydurma satır
  yazılabiliyordu ve panel gönderimi bütün koleksiyonu okuyor. Belirti yine
  "bildirim gelmiyor".
- **BİR KONTROLÜN KENDİ GEREKÇESİNİ BULMASI ALTINCI KEZ OLDU**, ve bu sefer
  `firestore.rules`'ta: `deletionRequests` bloğundaki "hasOnly OLMADAN
  istemci…" açıklaması, gerçek `hasOnly` satırı silindiğinde kontrolü yeşil
  bıraktı. `rulesBlock()` artık `//` yorumlarını atıyor. Aynı turda iki
  varyantı daha çıktı: bir **fonksiyon adını** aramak, gövdesi kısadevre
  edilmiş bir çağrıda da yeşil veriyor (`gunlukTavan` → çağrı aranıyor), ve bir
  **alan adını** aramak, o ad başka bir dalda geçiyorsa yeşil veriyor
  (`raffleEntries`'te `'uid'` → `hasOnly` listesi aranıyor). Üçü de kırılıp
  kırmızı verdiği görülerek düzeltildi.

- **`matches()` RE2 kullanıyor ve RE2, POSIX'in "sınıfın ilk karakteri olan `]`
  literaldir" kuralını UYGULAMIYOR.** `devices` jeton biçimi ilk hâlinde
  `'^Expo(nent)?PushToken[[]([A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64})[]]$'` yazıldı; `[[]` doğru
  (sınıf içinde `[` özel değil) ama `[]]` boş bir sınıf + bir `]` olarak
  ayrıştırılıyor. Ölçüldü: o desen **gerçek bir Expo jetonunu eşlemiyor**, yani
  deploy edilseydi her cihaz kaydı reddedilir ve push herkes için sessizce
  ölürdü — belirti yine "bildirim gelmiyor", ve sebebi bir güvenlik
  düzeltmesinin kendisi olurdu. Kaçışlı hâl (`\\[` / `\\]`) her lehçede aynı
  şeyi söylüyor; kural dizesindeki `\\` tek bir ters bölü üretiyor, Firebase'in
  kendi `\\s` örneğiyle aynı. **Bir kural regex'i yazıldığı gibi
  değerlendirilemez, çalıştırılması gerekiyor** — ve `firestore.rules` hiçbir
  yerel kontrolle çalıştırılamadığı için desen elle, bir motorda sınandı.

**Kapatılmayan iki bulgu, ve sebepleri:**

- **`registrations` numara işgali** ve **`eventSeats` sahte koltuk.** İkisi de
  kimliksiz yazmadan geliyor ve ikisinin de cevabı aynı: Firebase App Check.
  `uid`'i bugün zorunlu kılmak, kural yayınlandığı saniyede mağazadaki
  hesapsız sürümü kullanan herkesin kaydını reddeder — üretim kırılır. Bu
  defter o geçişi zaten yazıyor; **bulgu kapatılmadı, sırası beklendi.**
  Yazılmayan bir kontrolü "yazdım" saymamak için burada duruyor.
- **Doğrulanmamış e-posta yalnızca ekranda engelleniyor**, kuralda değil — ve
  `app/kayit/[id].tsx`'teki yorum aylarca tersini yazıyordu. Koşul ancak
  kimliğe bağlanabilir, yani `uid` zorunlu olduğu gün kurala
  `request.auth.token.email_verified == true` eklenecek. Yorum gerçeğe
  indirildi; **davranışı anlatan bir yorum davranış değildir** maddesinin
  kaçıncı tekrarı olduğunu saymıyorum artık.

**Taramanın kendi maliyeti ölçüldü:** 177 ajan, 75'i tamamlandı, **102'si
oturum kotasına takılıp öldü** (`You've hit your session limit`). Yani çürütme
turu YARIM: 22 bulgunun 18'i üç oyla doğrulandı, geri kalanı hiç oylanamadı.
Bir tarama raporunun "doğrulanan" sayısı, taranan şeyin tamamı değil —
**ölmeyen ajanların gördüğü kadarı.** Sonraki tur, kalan bulguların
listesinden devam etmeli.
