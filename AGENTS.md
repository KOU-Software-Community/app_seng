# KOÜ Yazılım Kulübü — agent notes

Expo SDK 57 / React Native 0.86 / expo-router. Read the exact versioned docs at
https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v57.0.0/ before writing any code — Expo has changed.

## Layout

- `app/` — expo-router routes. `app/(tabs)/` holds the four root screens plus a custom
  tab bar; everything else is a stack route.
- `src/theme.ts` — the only place colours, gradients, fonts, radii and spacing live.
- `src/data.ts` — types, fixed lists and the offline fallback. Content lives in
  Firestore; the admin panel writes it.
- `src/store.tsx` — registrations and notification prefs, persisted via AsyncStorage.

## Conventions

- Use `Txt` / `PixelTxt` from `src/components/ui.tsx` instead of raw `Text`. React Native
  does not synthesise font weights, so every weight is its own family name.
- Press Start 2P (`fonts.pixel`) is for badge labels, group headings, empty states and
  loading copy only — never body text, forms or buttons.
- Gradients are non-empty tuples (`GradientStops`). Pass `gradients.*` straight to
  `LinearGradient`; do not cast to `string[]`.
- UI copy is Turkish. Use `toLocaleLowerCase('tr')` / `toLocaleUpperCase('tr')` for case
  changes so dotted/dotless İ/ı behave.

## Checks

`npm run typecheck` must pass. `npx expo export --platform ios` catches bundling and
import errors without needing Xcode.

## Agent setup

Three layers, and only one of them lives in this repo:

- **MCP servers** — account level (claude.ai → Customize → Connectors). Nothing to copy;
  they are just there. On 21st.dev: `search` and all listing/metadata calls are free and
  unlimited, but **`get_component` is metered — 2 code pulls per day on the free tier**.
  Search widely, spend a pull only on a component actually being built. `get_theme`
  returns CSS free, but treat pulled themes as structural reference only, never as a
  palette source — the palette is `src/theme.ts`.
- **Account skills** — `~/.claude/skills/synced/`. Downloaded per container. Do not copy
  them here.
- **This repo** — `.claude/`, below. This is the part that is version controlled.

```

```

Repo-level skills load automatically — no install step, no network call, which is why
they are committed rather than installed. The hook exists because the cloud container is
rebuilt every session and graphify is the one thing it does not keep.

`graphify` maps the codebase into a queryable graph instead of re-reading it. It was
written from scratch here, so for a while there was nothing foreign to map — that stopped
being true once the admin panel, the event schema and the notification layer arrived.

**The graph is per-session and `graphify-out/` is gitignored.** The container is rebuilt
every time, and a committed graph would go stale the moment the code moved — a stale graph
is worse than none, because it describes a structure that no longer exists with complete
confidence. Rebuild it instead:

```
/graphify .
```

Three things worth scoping out when you do: the `assets/*.png` icons (the skill spends one
subagent per image and they say nothing about architecture), `.claude/skills/*` (agent
discipline prose, not part of the app), and **`design-source/`**. That last one is not
obvious and cost a rebuild to learn: it is a design-tool export kept for reference, not
shipping code, and its two bundled scripts took 121 of 597 nodes — a fifth of the graph —
and pushed `ImageSlot`, `get()` and `createRuntime()` above `useAppStore()` and
`useContent()` in the god-node ranking. The graph names the wrong centres unless it is
excluded.

`AGENTS.md` and `README.md` are worth keeping — they carry the data-flow description the
code alone does not state. Expect roughly a third of the doc-derived edges to dangle;
the AST half is deterministic and trustworthy, the prose half is not.

**Once it exists, questions about architecture, file relationships or project content are
graph queries first (`graphify query`, `path`, `explain`), file scans second.**

## Working rules

- **Do not open subagents** unless the task is large and genuinely parallel. They re-read
  everything and burn tokens.
- **Do not run workflows or deep research** unless asked for by name.
- **Do not publish artifacts.**
- **Do not work around the environment's network policy.** If something is unreachable,
  say it is unreachable. Never assert an outcome you did not observe.
- **Keys:** only publishable/anon keys reach the app; service-role and Supabase secret
  keys never do. **Both `.env` and `.env.local` are gitignored** — the line that called
  `.env` "committed" was wrong, and nothing has ever been committed to it. Either file
  is safe; `.env.local` wins where they overlap, matching Expo. Server-side entry points
  go through `scripts/load-env.ts`, because `import 'dotenv/config'` reads only `.env`
  and silently ignores `.env.local`.
- **An assertion that cannot fail is worse than no assertion** — it reports green. When
  you add a check, break the thing it guards and watch it go red before trusting it.
- Add `check:*` scripts to `package.json` when the first regression appears, not before,
  and start with the assertion that catches that regression.

## Load-bearing decisions — the why log

When a non-obvious bug is fixed, the **reason** goes here next to the rule, not just the
fix. The test: would a session with no memory of this one make the same mistake? If yes,
it belongs here. **A mistake made twice has earned a line in this file.**

- The graphify package is `graphifyy` — **two y's** — while the command is `graphify`,
  one y. Get it wrong and `uv tool install` fails silently and `/graphify` never appears.
- `graphify install` is a **separate step** from installing the package. The package
  provides the binary; that command is what registers the skill with the session.
- `$HOME/.local/bin` must be on `PATH` or the install succeeds and the command is still
  not found. The hook appends it to `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` so later shells inherit it.

### From the 1.1.0 release

- `ios.deploymentTarget` is a **minimum**, not a maximum. It was once set to `18.7.8`
  under a commit titled "lower iOS deployment target", which would have limited the App
  Store listing to devices running 18.7.8 or newer. Leave it unset unless there is a
  specific reason; the SDK default is the right answer.
- **A comment describing behaviour is not behaviour.** `Registration.synced` carried
  "`syncPending()` retries these" for months. `syncPending` had never been written —
  grep found the name in that one comment and nowhere else, and offline registrations
  were silently lost. When a comment names a function, check that it exists.
- Taking demo data out of `defaultState` does **not** take it off anyone's device. It is
  already in AsyncStorage on every install that ran the old build, so removing seeded
  state needs a migration in the hydration path too.
- `npx expo prebuild` rewrites `package.json` scripts to `expo run:android` / `expo
  run:ios` **every time it runs**. This project builds on EAS, not locally — revert
  those two lines after any prebuild.
- `android.blockedPermissions` does not delete the permission from the generated
  manifest; it adds `tools:node="remove"` and the Android manifest merger drops it at
  build time. Grepping the source manifest will show the permission still present and
  look like a failure. Check for the marker, not the absence of the line.
- `eas` commands act on the directory you are standing in. `eas project:info` prints the
  EAS project, not the bundle identifier — the identifier lives in `app.json` and is
  never configured in EAS. Confirm the project before any command that writes state;
  running one in the wrong repo targets a different app entirely.
- A notification icon renders at 24dp. The full three-line club wordmark turns to grey
  mush at that size; only the `KOÜ` line survives. Generate candidates and downscale
  them before choosing — this is not judgeable at full resolution.
- **In `startsAt` the wall-clock fields are the meaning; the offset is only carried.**
  `buildEvent` reads `2026-03-12T18:00` literally and derives every visible string from
  it, so the offset never reaches the screen. When the admin form became date + time
  pickers, `splitLocal` first *converted* a stored `…T15:00:00Z` to its +03:00 instant —
  which looks obviously right and silently changed the time the calendar showed. Split
  literally, restamp `+03:00` on save: nothing visible moves and the reminder stops
  firing at a different moment than the one on screen. The check that catches this is
  "değiştirmeden kaydet oynatmıyor" in `check:schema` — it builds an event, splits it,
  rebuilds it and compares every derived field.
- The panel's form CSS listed input types by hand (`input[type=text], input[type=password]`),
  so `date`, `time` and `number` fell through to browser defaults and sat visibly smaller
  than everything around them. It is now `input:not([type=checkbox])` — enumerate the
  exception, not the members.
- **`firestore.rules` in the repo does nothing.** Firestore reads its rules from the
  project, not from git, so an unpublished file leaves the Firestore default in force —
  and that default denies everything. The app said `Missing or insufficient permissions`
  while the rules file sat there looking correct, which it was. `service-account.json`
  is unrelated: it is the panel's Admin SDK key, and the app never touches it — the app
  is an unauthenticated client and the rules are the only thing standing between it and
  the data. Publish with `npm run rules:deploy`; no local check can tell you what is
  live, only that a rule was written at all.
- **The archive was never separate data.** `ArchiveEntry` was `{title, date, cat, year,
  count}` — every field except `count` already existed on `ClubEvent`, so a second
  collection meant entering the same real event twice and letting the two drift. It is
  now the past half of one `events` list (`splitByDate`), and `count` turned out to be a
  *photo* count, not attendance.
- **When a number is on screen, find the thing that produces it.** The archive header
  read "2023'ten bugüne 38 etkinlik · 412 fotoğraf" and each card claimed "24 foto",
  behind a four-photo lightbox. There is no photo storage anywhere in this app — all
  four slots were the same gradient placeholder and 412 counted nothing. Fiction with a
  UI around it is much harder to spot than fiction in a variable.
- **A retry is only safe if every write in it is idempotent.** `pushRegistration` was
  fixed to `setDoc(registrations/{regId})` so a resend lands on the same document — and
  then the seat count was almost added as `increment(1)` in the same batch, which would
  have reopened the identical hole one field over: the batch is atomic, but a resend
  after a lost `synced` flag runs it again. The count is a list of registration ids
  written with `arrayUnion`, which ignores an id it already holds.
- A Firestore rule that denies `create` on a document the client writes with
  `set(..., {merge: true})` does not degrade — it fails the whole write. `eventSeats`
  docs are born in the panel, but an event predating them would have had *no* student
  able to register, so the rule allows a first-seat create against an existing event.
- **A document id can carry a uniqueness rule that no query can.** One student number
  per event is enforced by making the registration's id `eventId__studentNo`: a second
  device writing the same student hits an existing document, and the rule only lets a
  write through that changes nothing but `createdAt`. No count, no read, nothing to race
  against — but the id is now personal data, so what goes in the public seat list is a
  separate random token.
- `set()` on a document that already exists is an **update** to Firestore rules, not a
  create. `allow create` alone therefore rejects the very retry that `setDoc` exists to
  make safe, and the registration retries forever getting denied every time. The narrow
  `affectedKeys().hasOnly(['createdAt'])` update branch is what lets an identical resend
  through while still refusing a different one.
- **Only retry what a retry can fix.** `permission-denied` is a rules decision and will
  be the same next launch, so it stops the background retry and surfaces a manual one
  instead of burning a write per app open behind a "Gönderiliyor…" that never resolves.
- Grepping `firestore.rules` as one string finds a line in *some* block, not the block
  you meant. Deleting the retry branch from `registrations` left the check green because
  `raffleEntries` still had the identical line — `rulesBlock()` in `check:release` slices
  one block out before matching.
- **Firebase Cloud Storage costs money on any project created after 2024** — the
  default bucket needs Blaze, and the config's `storageBucket` value is a computed name
  that appears whether or not a bucket exists. Event photos live in Supabase Storage
  instead; Firestore stays where it is. The app never touched a storage SDK — it renders
  a URL — so swapping providers was one file.
- **A release build has no console.** `isFirebaseConfigured` being false is always a
  broken build — `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` is inlined at build time, so a missing EAS environment
  variable means the app connects to nothing. It only logged, so the app opened empty
  and silent; in a store build there is no way to see why. It sets `error` now, which
  puts `ContentNotice` on screen.
- EAS environment variables belong to an environment (production/preview/development).
  Every build profile in `eas.json` names its `environment` explicitly rather than
  relying on a default — the failure mode of guessing wrong is a store build with no
  configuration at all.
- **Metro's transform cache survives an `.env` change.** Measuring whether
  `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` values are inlined gave "not in the bundle" three times, because
  earlier exports in the same session had run with no `.env` and the transformed module
  was cached. `npx expo export --clear` reversed the answer. Any measurement of what a
  build contains has to clear the cache first, or it measures an older build.
- **`.env.local` is an Expo convention, not a dotenv one.** `import 'dotenv/config'`
  loads `.env` and nothing else, so a key placed exactly where the docs said belongs
  produced no error at all — just an undefined variable and a panel that did not work.
  `scripts/load-env.ts` loads `.env.local` then `.env`; dotenv does not overwrite what
  is already set, so first-loaded wins.
- **One failed read inside `Promise.all` blacks out everything beside it.** `fetchContent`
  fetched events, raffles and `eventSeats` together; the seat rule was not published yet,
  so the whole app opened empty with "Missing or insufficient permissions" while the
  events were perfectly readable. Seat counts are an enrichment — they are fetched
  separately now and their failure only costs the remaining-seat line.
- A publishable Supabase key in the panel's secret slot fails as
  `row-level security policy`, which never names the actual cause. The key type is
  visible in the value itself — `sb_publishable_` prefix, or `role: anon` in a legacy
  JWT payload — so the panel refuses before the first request instead of relaying a
  message about policies.
- **An error branch you never triggered is a branch you never wrote.** The panel's
  "Storage bucket not found" message matched `err.code === 404`; gaxios 6 puts the
  number in `err.status` and leaves `code` unset, so the branch never ran and the
  operator kept seeing the generic page. It was written from the shape of the error I
  assumed, never from one I had seen. `check:panel` now carries the real object out of a
  panel log — the same way `check:html` carries real announcement bodies.
- **A field the form stops showing is a field the form stops sending.** The archive
  form hides capacity and the badge because they mean nothing for an event that
  already happened — and saving would then have wiped both. They are rendered as
  hidden inputs instead, and `check:panel` asserts the values survive.
- **Upload after validating, never before.** A rejected form that has already written
  its files leaves objects in Storage that no event points at — quota is paid for them
  and nobody ever notices. The panel validates, then uploads, and deletes what it
  uploaded if the second build fails.
- `makePublic()` throws on a bucket with uniform bucket-level access, which new Firebase
  projects turn on by default. The download URL with a `firebaseStorageDownloadTokens`
  metadata value works under both settings and does not make the bucket listable.
- A multer `fileFilter` that answers `cb(null, false)` **drops the file silently**: the
  event saves, the operator believes the photo uploaded, and it is nowhere. Pass an
  error instead, and translate multer's codes — an unexplained "Bir şeyler ters gitti"
  after picking seven photos tells the operator nothing.
- **A check that reads comments finds its own rationale.** A guard has now gone red
  against correct code three times because the comment explaining *why* something was
  removed still contains its name — `addDoc`, `increment(1)`, `HOLD_MS`. Strip comments
  before matching source; `check:release` has a `strip()` for exactly this.
- The calendar/archive boundary is **the day, not the instant**. Splitting on the start
  time would move a three-hour event into the archive while it is still running; an
  event stays on the calendar through its own day and moves the next morning. `today`
  comes from `todayLocal`, which reads +03:00 rather than the device clock — a phone
  abroad otherwise archives an event the club still has on today's calendar.
- **`newArchEnabled` was removed from the SDK 57 config schema.** It was valid in 52–53
  and did nothing here — the new architecture is the only one in 57, so the flag turned
  on something already on. A no-op field is invisible until the schema check calls it an
  additional property and fails the EAS build. `check:release` greps `app.json` for it.
- **A version guard's authority is the *installed* `expo`.** Expected versions come from
  `node_modules/expo/bundledNativeModules.json`, so a stale `expo` ships a stale list and
  the guard goes green against yesterday's expectations — locally it passed while
  `expo doctor` on EAS listed eleven mismatches, because the local `expo` was 57.0.12 and
  doctor compared against 57.0.17's list. `expo` is not in its own list, so it is pinned
  separately against the installed version.
- `npx expo install --check` needs api.expo.dev and **the container's proxy blocks it**
  (`HTTP Proxy Network Error: Forbidden`). That is not a reason to type version numbers
  by hand — the npm registry itself is reachable, and api.expo.dev was never where the
  answer lived: every `expo` release carries the list it expects in its own
  `bundledNativeModules.json`. `npm run deps:sync` reads the newest patch of the current
  SDK major from the registry, installs it, then writes that release's list into
  `package.json`. Expo's own major stays put: 57 → 58 is a migration, not a patch bump.
  Run it whenever `paket sürümleri SDK ile uyuşuyor` goes red.
- **A tool that reads its expectations from disk must prove what it read.**
  `deps:sync` takes the expected versions from the installed `expo`'s
  `bundledNativeModules.json`. `git pull` updates `package.json` and leaves
  `node_modules` alone — so the first thing it did on a freshly pulled checkout was
  read *yesterday's* list and rewrite eleven correct versions **backwards**. The fix is
  not a warning: it verifies the installed `expo` is the target before opening the
  list, installs it if not, and re-checks afterwards. The same trap made
  `check:release` print `~57.0.15 ≠ ~57.0.10`, which reads as "the new version is
  wrong"; it now reports the stale `node_modules` instead and says `npm ci`.
- **Every check ran against a tree where `node_modules` already matched.** That is the
  one state a dependency-sync tool never finds in the wild — after a pull, after a
  branch switch, on a colleague's first clone, `node_modules` is behind by definition.
  Test the state the user is actually in, not the state you happen to be in.
- **A successful upload is not a delivered build.** `eas.json` carried
  `submit.production.android.releaseStatus: "draft"`, and a draft release sits in Play
  Console without being distributed to any track — `eas submit` reports success, the
  build is genuinely there, and every tester on the internal track sees "öğe
  bulunamadı". Play needs draft for the *first* upload of an app that has never had a
  release; leaving it there afterwards is a test channel with no testers. `check:release`
  now refuses it, so turning it back on has to be deliberate.
- **TestFlight's "the requested app is not available or doesn't exist" is an App Store
  Connect availability fact, not a build fact.** The EAS xcodebuild log settles the
  build side on its own: `ARCHIVE SUCCEEDED`, zero errors, `beta-reports-active = 1`
  (an entitlement only App Store distribution profiles carry), no `ProvisionedDevices`
  (so not ad-hoc), `get-task-allow = 0`, minimum iOS 15.1. A binary that signs like that
  cannot be the reason a tester cannot install it. Do not go looking in `app.json` —
  export compliance is already answered there, and it produces a "Missing Compliance"
  banner, not this error.
  The reported cause that matches the signature — *visible in TestFlight, notification
  arrives, install fails instantly* — is the app's **Pricing and Availability →
  App Availability** left with countries in `Processing`, which is account-shaped: it
  hits every app at once and survives new builds, which is why it looks like a build
  problem and is not one.
  **But an amber clock on that page is not by itself that state.** The summary shows
  `🕐 1 Available / 🕐 174 Not Available`, which reads like something pending; opening
  the detail shows the per-country status is `Available on App Release`, and that is the
  correct, settled state for an app whose first version has not shipped yet. Reading the
  summary clock as "stuck processing" cost a wrong diagnosis here and nearly cost the
  operator a pointless change to their deliberate single-country setting. Judge it from
  the per-country status, never from the clock. Narrowing availability is also not a
  testing problem in itself: TestFlight has no territory restriction, a tester in any
  territory is eligible. Next is Agreements, Tax and Banking pending account-wide.
  Beyond that it is a known Apple-side bug that only Developer Support clears.
  **Unverified from this repo:** none of it can be observed here — `eas-cli` has no
  credentials in the container and App Store Connect has no read path. Treat the above
  as where to look, not as a diagnosis, and never assert which one it was.
- **EAS's remote version counter and Play's used-code list are two separate ledgers.**
  With `appVersionSource: "remote"`, `autoIncrement` bumps a number EAS keeps for the
  project — initialised from the local config and updated only by EAS builds. It has no
  idea what Play already holds. So a fresh build can auto-increment perfectly and still
  land on a `versionCode` Play has seen, and the error reads as though autoIncrement had
  failed when it did exactly what it promises. `eas build:version:get --platform android`
  shows the counter; `eas build:version:set` moves it above what the store holds. A
  rebuild alone does not fix a counter that is behind — it just burns another number.
- **`releaseStatus` lives in `submit`, so changing it does not need a new build.** The
  artifact is unaffected by anything under `eas.json` → `submit`; only `eas submit` reads
  it. When that setting stranded a build as a draft in Play, the fix was to publish the
  draft already uploaded there (Internal testing → the draft → review → roll out), not
  to rebuild. Saying "the config only affects future submits" invited exactly the
  unnecessary build it was meant to prevent — say which command reads a setting, not
  just when it takes effect.
- **Deploying the panel needs `nixpacks.toml`, and both lines in it are load-bearing.**
  Nixpacks recognises this repo as a Node app and would run `npm start` — which here is
  `expo start`, the mobile dev server. The panel would never come up and the deploy
  would still report success. And the panel's runtime packages (`express`,
  `firebase-admin`, `multer`, `sharp`, `@supabase/supabase-js`, `tsx`) sit in
  `devDependencies`, which is right for the mobile side — Metro never reaches them — but
  the lockfile marks all seven `dev: true`, so an install under `NODE_ENV=production`
  (what Nixpacks sets) skips every one. Both failures land in the same place: the build
  goes green and the container dies on boot with `Cannot find module 'express'`.
  `check:release` fails if either the `--include=dev` or the start command disappears.
- **A session cookie without `Secure` is the deploy turning a local convenience into an
  exposure.** The panel ran on `localhost` for months, where `Secure` would have
  prevented login outright — browsers do not store it over plain HTTP. Put the same
  panel behind Coolify and it holds student names and numbers on the open internet.
  The flag is decided per request from `req.secure`, which needs `trust proxy` because
  a reverse proxy terminates TLS and forwards plain HTTP. `cookieHeader` lives in its
  own module for one reason: importing `server.ts` starts `app.listen`, so nothing in
  it can be asserted without standing a server up.
- **`strip()` knows `//` and `/* */`; `nixpacks.toml` is commented in `#`.** The guard
  above read the raw TOML — and that file explains, in its own comments, both of the
  strings it searches for. Delete the real `--include=dev` and the whole `[start]`
  block, leave the prose describing them, and the check still passed: verified, it did.
  Same trap as the JS one already in this log, one file format over, and it fails the
  more dangerous way round — green against a config that cannot boot. It strips `#` to
  end of line now, counting quotes first, because a `#` inside a command is not a
  comment and truncating there would fail a correct file.
- **`??` does not catch an empty environment variable, and a deploy panel makes empty
  the easy mistake.** `Number(process.env.ADMIN_PORT ?? process.env.PORT ?? 4000)` reads
  0 when `ADMIN_PORT` exists and is blank — `''` is not nullish, so the fallback never
  runs, and `Number('')` is 0. `listen(0)` is not an error: the kernel hands out a random
  free port, the container reports healthy, the log is clean, and the reverse proxy never
  reaches it. This repo's own `.env.example` ships `ADMIN_PORT=` empty under a comment
  promising 4000, so the documented path produced the broken case. The decision lives in
  `resolvePort` (`admin/port.ts`) now — blank, non-numeric, zero and out-of-range all
  fall through — and `check:release` asserts `server.ts` still goes through it, because a
  pure function nobody calls guards nothing.
- **`@types/*` is not auto-included here, so a test runner's globals are invisible
  to `tsc`.** Adding Jest made `typecheck` fail with `Cannot find name 'describe'`
  in every test file while `@types/jest` sat correctly installed in
  `node_modules/@types`. TypeScript normally pulls those in automatically when
  `types` is unspecified, and this config never restricted it — but `tsc
  --listFiles` showed only the `@types` packages something *imports* (express,
  multer, react), never a global one. Whatever `expo/tsconfig.base` does with
  `moduleResolution: bundler` and `customConditions`, the measured behaviour is
  that automatic inclusion does not happen; naming `"types": ["jest"]` fixes it
  and cannot lose anything, because nothing was being auto-included to begin with.
  Diagnose this with `--listFiles`, not by re-reading the config: the config
  looks correct and is not.
- **`@testing-library/react-native` 14 made `render`, `rerender` and `unmount`
  async.** Ported tests written for 13 call them bare, and the failure names
  nothing useful: `render` returns a promise, `screen` is still unbound, and the
  next line throws "`render` function has not been called". Worse is the
  unawaited `unmount()`: the test that forgot it passes, and the *next* test in
  the file fails instead, because cleanup lands in the middle of its render.
  That one cost the longest — the failing test passed in isolation, which is the
  signal to stop reading the failing test and start reading the one before it.
- **A seven-day `gcTime` is a seven-day timer, and Jest waits for it.** After the
  suite went green, `jest` never exited: every test that mounted a real
  `QueryClient` left one `setTimeout` per query, sized to `gcTime`, which
  `createQueryClient` sets to the offline retention window.
  `--detectOpenHandles` reports nothing, because nothing leaked — an ordinary
  pending timer is not a leak. The tell is that a minimal render test exits
  fine while the provider one hangs. Tests own the client they mount and
  `clear()` it afterwards; `--forceExit` would have hidden it and, with it,
  every future real leak.
- **`rescheduleReminders` cancels every scheduled notification, so a second
  scheduler is a silent delete.** The AI Gündem digest needed a daily local
  notification, and adding it as its own scheduler would have worked in
  isolation and failed in place: the next reminder rebuild calls
  `cancelAllScheduledNotificationsAsync()` and takes the digest with it. No
  error, no log — a notification that simply stops arriving, which nobody
  reports as a bug because nobody knows it was due. What gets scheduled is now
  decided in one pure function (`src/notificationPlan.ts`) and the effectful
  half only applies the list.
- **Quiet hours may move a reminder and must not move the digest.** Nobody chose
  03:00 for a reminder — it fell there from the event's own start time — so
  shifting it to 08:00 is a service. The digest hour is picked by hand on the
  settings screen, and moving it means a notification arriving at a time the
  settings screen does not show. Same class as the calendar entry above: the
  wall-clock the user set is the meaning.
