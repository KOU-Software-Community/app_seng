# The cloud container is rebuilt from scratch every session, so anything that
# is not committed to the repo is gone. This restores the one thing that
# matters and is not in git: graphify.
#
# Three traps, all real:
#   1. The package is `graphifyy` (two y's); the command is `graphify` (one y).
#      Typo it and the install fails silently and /graphify never shows up.
#   2. `graphify install` is a separate step. Installing the package is not
#      enough - that command is what registers the skill with the session.
#   3. $HOME/.local/bin must be on PATH, or `uv tool install` succeeds and the
#      command is still not found. The CLAUDE_ENV_FILE line carries that to
#      later shells too.
#
# Idempotent: re-running is harmless.

# Supabase skills. The AI Gundem port's backend half is Supabase - RLS,
# migrations, edge functions - and these two carry that discipline. Same reason
# as graphify below: they are not in this repo and the container forgets them.
#
# Guarded on the directory, not `command -v`: `skills add` writes files and
# symlinks them into ~/.claude/skills, it does not install a binary, so there is
# no command to look for.
